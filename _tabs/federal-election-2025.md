---

In the lead up to the Federal provincial election on April 28, 2025, the Tri-Cities Transport Action Group (TriTAG) sent out a questionnaire for MP candidates in Waterloo Region (Cambridge, Kitchener Centre, Kitchener—Conestoga, Kitchener South—Hespeler, and Waterloo) to understand their positions on key federal issues of local relevance around transit, active transportation, and land use.

We contacted all registered candidates by email on April 10, and are publishing all responses we received by April 18. Any responses received afterward will be indicated with an asterisk. Responses are ordered under each question theme:
* [Local Transit](#local-transit)
* [Intercity Transit](#intercity-transit)
* [Land Use and Housing](#land-use-and-housing)
* [Vehicles](#vehicles)

### Local Transit

            <td>The Green Party of Canada supports the federal government providing operational funding for local transit agencies like Grand River Transit. While infrastructure investment is important, it is not sufficient on its own—transit systems must also be affordable, reliable, and frequent to effectively serve communities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Operational funding ensures that transit services can run at full capacity, improve service quality, and meet the growing demand for sustainable transportation. The Green Party believes in a comprehensive approach to public transit that includes stable, long-term operational support to help cities transition to low-carbon, accessible, and equitable mobility for all.</td>

While I welcome the federal government's investment in transit infrastructure through the Canada Public Transit Fund, I've consistently pushed for this funding to also cover operational costs for local agencies like Grand River Transit.<br><br>

In fact, in my Motion 92, I specifically called for the permanent Public Transit Fund to be put in place immediately - not delayed until 2026 as currently planned - and expanded to cover public transit operations with an extra $3 billion annually beyond current commitments. Motion 92 calls for a windfall profit tax on the excess revenues of oil and gas companies to fund climate and affordability solutions for our community and Canadians across the country.</td>

Support for Federal Operational Funding: Greens generally believe there should be a reliable stream of federal support for transit operations so local agencies like Grand River Transit are not constrained by unpredictable municipal or provincial budgets.<br><br>

Environmental & Social Benefits: A strong operations budget means more frequent routes, better weekend/evening service, and lower fares, which leads to higher ridership, lower emissions, and greater social equity.<br><br>

Implementation: We could achieve this through predictable transfers or new federal-provincial agreements. The key is stable, multi-year funding that local transit agencies can count on.</td>

Second, we need to address the fragmentation between levels of government. When I've spoken with local officials about our ION expansion or the long-delayed two-way all-day GO service, I consistently hear about the challenges of navigating multiple bureaucracies with different requirements. The federal government should establish integrated project offices that bring together federal, provincial, and municipal staff under one roof for major transit projects.<br><br>

We would also ensure that the project prioritizes environmental sustainability, Indigenous consultation, and public ownership to maintain long-term affordability and accountability. By treating high-speed rail as a nation-building climate infrastructure investment—on par with major highway or pipeline projects—we can finally bring this long-overdue vision to life.</td>

Second, collaborative planning: Bring together federal and provincial governments, Indigenous communities, and transportation experts to create a transparent implementation plan with clear timelines and milestones.<br><br>

Third, green job creation: Ensure the project prioritizes Canadian workers and suppliers and positions Canada as a leader in sustainable transportation infrastructure.<br><br>

Public support is equally vital; I’d emphasize the project’s benefits, like cutting travel times, boosting economic growth, and reducing emissions. Finally, thorough technical planning—route selection, environmental assessments, and seamless integration with existing transit—is essential to avoid delays.

 - Transit-Oriented Development (TOD): To promote housing and employment near transit, the federal government can fund TOD projects, offer tax incentives to developers, and tie federal transit funding to TOD principles, fostering sustainable urban growth.<br>

We support the creation of a publicly funded and operated non-market housing sector, including co-ops and community land trusts, with a strong emphasis on affordability, accessibility, and environmental performance. To ensure this development is transit-oriented, the federal government must prioritize building near existing or planned transit infrastructure, require walkable, mixed-use designs, and work collaboratively with local governments to integrate housing with transportation planning. Federal funding should be tied to principles of smart growth, climate resilience, and social equity to create vibrant, connected communities that serve both people and the planet.</td>

For transit-oriented development, we should tie infrastructure funding to requirements that municipalities zone for higher density near transit corridors, create mixed-use developments, and prioritize affordable housing.

Funding should prioritize projects that reduce car dependence and align with municipal transit plans.

To improve pedestrian safety, we support updating national vehicle safety standards to include pedestrian impact protections, mandating technologies like automatic emergency braking and blind spot detection, and regulating vehicle size and front-end design to reduce the risk of injury. To cut vehicular pollution, the Green Party advocates for rapidly phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles through stricter emissions regulations, expanding zero-emission vehicle incentives, and investing in public transit, active transportation, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. These changes must be paired with urban planning that prioritizes people over cars, encouraging compact, walkable communities and reducing overall car dependency.</td>
