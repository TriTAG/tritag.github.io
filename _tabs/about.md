The Tri-Cities Transport Action Group (TriTAG) was founded in 2009 to advocate for improved walking, biking, and transit in Waterloo Region. We're a small, all-volunteer group focused on pushing our governments to make practical policy, infrastructure, and operations changes to make it easier for people to have meaningful choice in getting around with less reliance on cars.

**Purpose**: To effectively advocate for improved transportation options in Waterloo Region, through policy and infrastructure for better walking, biking, and transit.

**Vision**: People can get around and to/from Waterloo Region without driving, easily and with dignity.

**Mission**: TriTAG will:
* Advocate for ambitious but pragmatic policy changes on transportation and land use  
* Push to improve programs, while also providing support for imperfect ones when they improve outcomes  
* Inform the public about relevant transportation policy and government updates  
* Help the public engage with staff and elected officials on these topics
