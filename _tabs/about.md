The Tri-Cities Transport Action Group (TriTAG) was founded in 2009 to advocate for improved walking, biking, and transit in Waterloo Region. We're a small, all-volunteer group focused on pushing our governments to make practical policy, infrastructure, and operations changes to make it easier for people to have meaningful choice in getting around with less reliance on cars.
