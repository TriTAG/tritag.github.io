The Tri-Cities Transport Action Group was founded in 2009 to advocate for improved walking, biking, and transit in Waterloo Region. It's a small group focused on pushing our governments on practical policy, infrastructure, and operations changes to make it easier for people to have meaningful choice in getting around without a car.
