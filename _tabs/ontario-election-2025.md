---

In the lead up to the Ontario provincial election on February 27, 2025, the Tri-Cities Transport Action Group (TriTAG) sent out a questionnaire for MPP candidates in Waterloo Region to understand their positions on key issues around transit and active transportation. In partnership with several groups, we also asked a question about inter-municipal transit for candidates in Waterloo Region as well as Brantford—Brant, Guelph, and Wellington—Halton Hills. 

We made our best effort to get the questionnaire out to all registered candidates. All responses we received from registered candidates in those districts by February 21 are ordered under each question theme:
* [Inter-municipal Transit](#inter-municipal-transit)
* [ION Stage 2 LRT](#ion-stage-2-lrt)
* [Bike Lanes](#bike-lanes)
* [Kitchener GO](#kitchener-go)
* [Municipal Transit Operations Funding](#municipal-transit-operations-funding)

### Inter-municipal Transit

*These questions on inter-municipal transit are on behalf of TriTAG as well as [Transit Action Alliance of Guelph](https://www.taaguelph.com/), [Conestoga Students Inc](https://www.conestogastudents.com/), and [More Transit Southern Ontario](https://www.moretransit.ca/). They were posed to candidates in ridings covering Waterloo Region, Guelph, and Brantford.*

There are currently no direct transit connections between Brantford and Waterloo Region, and limited, weekday-only service between Kitchener-Waterloo and Guelph. Meanwhile, Cambridge and Guelph have no transit connections, despite being less than 20 minutes apart by car.

**A. Would you press Metrolinx to provide frequent daily service connecting Brantford, Cambridge, Guelph, and Kitchener-Waterloo through GO Transit?**

**B. Would you support providing provincial funding to Grand River Transit, Guelph Transit, and/or Brantford Transit to provide inter-municipal transit links?**

These connections are needed for family, business and medical connections. An electric train line must be built connecting Niagara Falls, Windsor and Sarnia to take heavy freight trucks off our highways. Our air quality suffers from connecting American cities.</td>

I would also like to see all day Go Train service into the Brantford Brant area. Our population has grown dramatically- and it will continue to grow. I believe we can support Go Train service, that it would take many vehicles off the road, easy congestion and helping the environment.</td>

For over 15 years, we have seen a number of mandates that have included promises for enhancing service for residents in the Region of Waterloo.<br><br>

These transit projects are long overdue - our province is growing considerably, and the region is expected to surpass 1-million citizens by 2050.<br><br>

In order to accommodate the need for travel among Brantford, Cambridge and Hespeler, Guelph, and Kitchener-Waterloo, we need to provide that investment to increase service and we are ready to do so.<br><br>

As for the GO Transit issue - the provincial government has done a poor job at representing and standing up for the issues of our community.<br><br>

Service should be frequent and consistent to ensure people can get from their homes to the places they need in a timely manner, and the state of GO Transit in our region does not reflect that.<br><br>

We also have to advocate for physical expansion into underserved areas of the region, beyond central Kitchener, that’s exactly what myself and my party colleagues will do.

GO Transit provides consistent scheduling, a unified fare system, and efficient regional connections, avoiding fragmented service from multiple municipal operators.<br><br>

Funding local transit agencies like Grand River Transit, Guelph Transit, and Brantford Transit for inter-municipal links could lead to overlapping routes, inefficiencies, and inconsistent service levels. These agencies are primarily responsible for local transit, and inter-city expansion should be handled by a province-wide provider with the infrastructure to manage long-distance routes effectively.<br><br>

Additionally, municipal governments can fund their own inter-municipal transit if they see a need, rather than relying on provincial subsidies. Focusing on GO Transit ensures better regional service without redundant spending, making it a more cost-effective, streamlined, and reliable solution for improving transit across these cities.</td>

3. **Traffic Congestion Mitigation**: Emphasize that improved transit service can help reduce traffic congestion on major roadways. Encouraging more people to use public transit rather than personal vehicles will lessen the burden on transportation infrastructure.
4. **Environmental Benefits**: Discuss the positive environmental implications of providing better public transit options. Enhanced GO Transit services can contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable travel choices.<br>
5. **Public Health Considerations**: Mention that increased public transit usage can lead to improved public health outcomes by reducing air pollution and encouraging more active lifestyles among citizens, such as walking or cycling to transit stops.<br>
6. **Support for Commuters**: Advocate for services that cater to the diverse needs of commuters, including peak service times, affordable pricing, and accessibility options for those with disabilities. <br>
7. **Investment in Infrastructure**: Encourage investment in transit infrastructure and facilities that would support this increased service, such as modern transit hubs, bike storage, and amenities that enhance the overall commuter experience.<br>
8. **Advocacy for Funding**: Suggest that securing adequate funding from provincial and federal sources is essential for making this service a reality. Collaboration with government officials can facilitate the necessary financial support for expanding GO Transit routes.<br>
9. **Enhanced Communication**: Stress the need for Metrolinx to engage in transparent communication with the public regarding service plans, timelines, and community impact. Keeping residents informed helps build trust and support for transit initiatives.<br>
10. **Long-term Vision**: Encourage Metrolinx to adopt a long-term vision for regional transit that not only addresses current needs but also anticipates future growth and demand in the region.</td>

### ION Stage 2 LRT

Planning for ION Stage 2 has been underway for years, and the latest cost estimates have [tripled to $4.5 billion](https://www.cambridgetoday.ca/local-news/price-tag-for-bringing-ion-to-cambridge-set-at-45-billion-6814115). Cost escalations have plagued transit projects across North America, and [transit cost](https://transitcosts.com/) experts have identified hands-off procurement approaches as a major contributor.

**A. Would you support the province providing funding—not contingent on requiring public-private partnership procurement—for the Region of Waterloo’s ION Stage 2?**

**B. Would you support the province providing funding for initial design planning and hands-on project management for ION Stage 2?**

            <td>Our Ontario Liberal Party has made it a policy priority to support the region in delivering LRT service to Cambridge.<br><br>

I’m not an expert, but I believe that the process of developing a strong LRT expansion plan needs to be transparent and accountable to our local governments and the community - working directly with the people that will be affected by its expansion.<br><br>

I know that communities, like the one I support at the Kingsdale community centre, are dependent on public transit to reach vital services, their place of work, their schools and post secondary education, and the grocery store.<br><br>

An expanded LRT would also relieve congestion from inter-city travel amongst our residents in the region, those who may want to visit amenities and small businesses just a city away.<br><br>

Better transit solutions and an LRT to improve inter-city transit in the region is long overdue, and we must be committed to supporting regional partners to ensure transparency and accountability every step of the way.<br><br>

The regional and municipal governments know what is best for the community, and I feel that while our province should provide that support and have involvement, it is necessary to make sure the decision-making is primarily made at the local level.<br><br>

In the Region of Waterloo, we are all very interconnected; students in Cambridge may attend post secondary in Waterloo, residents of Kitchener may need to get to their place of work in Cambridge - the bottom line is that we need to expand the LRT to improve the transit network and support the community.

            <td>The ION light rail transit (LRT) in Waterloo Region has been a costly failure, plagued by poor planning, massive disruptions, and underwhelming ridership. The project cost $868 million, yet it has failed to significantly improve public transportation. Ridership has struggled, with many residents continuing to rely on cars due to the ION’s limited reach and unreliable service.<br><br>

Construction lasted five years, devastating local businesses along King Street. Many never recovered from the loss of foot traffic. The ION has also worsened traffic congestion, as road layouts were permanently altered, creating frustrating bottlenecks.<br><br>

Service interruptions have been frequent, with mechanical failures, weather-related shutdowns, and accidents causing delays. Replacement buses during shutdowns are slow and unreliable, making the entire system inconvenient. Additionally, the fare system is poorly implemented, with confusing ticketing options and inconsistent enforcement, leading to fare evasion.<br><br>

Despite all these issues, officials continue pushing for a Cambridge extension projected to cost over $4.5 billion, raising serious concerns about wasting even more taxpayer money. The ION has been nothing more than an overpriced, ineffective transit experiment, proving to be a massive financial mistake with little to show for it.</td>

### Bike Lanes

Bill 212 will be removing several bike lanes on major streets in Toronto and is requiring municipalities to get provincial approvals if they want to remove lanes in order to put in bike infrastructure.

**Do you believe municipalities should need per-project provincial approvals to build safe, protected bike infrastructure where it may require reductions in car lanes?**

This infrastructure is also important for promoting safe and sustainable transportation that can help to reduce congestion.<br><br>

   Metrolinx has been discussing this expansion for over a decade with little tangible progress. I would push for a firm timeline with publicly available milestones and regular progress updates on track improvements, agreements with CN (which owns key sections of the rail line), and service expansions.<br><br>

2. Leverage Political and Public Pressure<br>
   The lack of action is unacceptable. I would work with regional leaders, businesses, and community advocates to apply pressure and ensure this remains a priority issue. A coordinated effort will make it harder for Metrolinx to delay further.<br><br>

3. Push for Track and Infrastructure Upgrades<br>
   One of the biggest obstacles is track availability. I would press Metrolinx to secure dedicated rail corridors and make the necessary improvements to eliminate reliance on CN’s freight schedule.<br><br>

4. Advocate for Cambridge Inclusion<br>
   With no clear GO rail plans for Cambridge, I would push for Cambridge to be formally included in regional transit discussions and future rail expansion plans, ensuring it is not left behind.<br><br>

5. Demand Transparency and Public Accountability<br>
   I would push for regular public updates, independent audits, and greater oversight of Metrolinx’s planning and execution. If delays persist, Metrolinx should be held responsible with enforceable commitments and clear consequences for failing to meet deadlines.<br><br>

This project has been stalled for far too long, and Metrolinx must finally deliver on its promises to Waterloo Region.</td>

### Municipal Transit Operations Funding

In Waterloo Region, Grand River Transit's [Business Plan](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/grt-business-plan-2025-2030.aspx) for 2025-2030 will include a 10 minute frequent transit network, overnight buses, and expanded transit to the townships. Upper level government funding increases the likelihood of ambitious plans like this getting off the ground.

Transit construction projects attract upper level government interest as a visible investment, but in recent decades in Canada, they have had less interest in providing the reliable operational funding which enables higher service levels. Currently the province only provides support through the gas tax fund, and municipalities have to support the majority through property taxes.

**Will you support increasing provincial funding for municipal transit operations and maintenance?**

I will advocate for allocation of funding which has previously been taken from taxpayers in our region, so we can bring it back to the community and invest in the projects and infrastructure that matters.<br><br>

Expanding to our townships and auxiliary villages/towns is very important. Many people who work in these areas have limited ability to get to their place of work, and I understand the townships have asked for this for some time, but without enough resources, it has yet to happen.<br><br>

I understand the importance of advocating for my riding, but I also understand advocating for the issues that affect our neighbouring communities is just as important. Some residents in my community may be affected by lack of service to our townships, and I will work to advocate for them.<br><br>

Lastly, we have to keep our local services operating smoothly and efficiently. One bus out could mean the difference for someone making it on time for work, a job interview, or an important medical appointment, and we can’t have that.

municipal transit operations funding, particularly in relation to Grand River Transit’s plans for 2025-2030, you might consider the following points:<br>
1. **Importance of Sustainable Funding**: Stress the need for stable and predictable operational funding from upper levels of government. This funding is crucial for maintaining and enhancing service levels, especially as transit demand increases.<br>
2. **Support for Ambitious Projects**: Highlight how reliable funding can help realize ambitious projects like the proposed 10-minute frequent transit network and overnight bus service, ultimately improving public transit access for residents across the region.<br>
3. **Equity in Funding Distribution**: Advocate for a more equitable distribution of funding across municipalities. Urban and rural areas alike should be able to benefit from operational funding to ensure equitable access to transit services.<br>
4. **Encouragement for Partnerships**: Suggest that upper levels of government create partnerships with municipalities to co-fund operational costs. This collaborative approach can lead to innovative solutions and enhanced service delivery.<br>
5. **Investing in Public Health and Environment**: Emphasize that improved transit funding is not just about transportation; it also contributes to public health by reducing reliance on cars and decreasing congestion, as well as mitigating climate change by reducing emissions.<br>
6. **Community Engagement**: Recommend actively involving the community in shaping transit plans, as local input can lead to more effective service models that meet the specific needs of residents.<br>
7. **The Role of Technology**: Encourage the incorporation of technology in transit operations to enhance efficiency and service delivery. Funding should also be allocated for technology improvements to provide real-time information and optimize routing.<br>
8. **Financial Viability of Transit Services**: Discuss the financial viability of transit systems. Increased service levels and reliability can lead to higher ridership, which in turn generates more revenue and reduces the burden on property taxes.<br>
9. **Long-standing Investment**: Advocate for long-term investment in public transit as part of a broader infrastructure strategy. Investment in transit not only improves accessibility but also stimulates local economies and job creation.<br>
10. **Encouragement of Active Transportation**: Mention that supporting transit operations can promote active transportation modes such as biking and walking, as convenient transit services often encourage such behaviors.<br>
    By including these points in your comments, you can effectively advocate for enhanced municipal transit operations funding to support ambitious and sustainable transit initiatives in Waterloo Region.</td>

I take the ION and connecting bus everyday. I have had to go over piles of snow with my 18-month old strapped to me just to get on the bus. Sidewalks being cleared and having dedicated clearing for bus stops is so critical to ensuring people continue to have access to transit services.

The Ontario Liberals are committed to being a real partner to municipalities, but that means more than just increasing operational funding—it means fixing the root of the problem. Instead of continuing the cycle of municipalities relying on unpredictable provincial transfers, we need to upload more responsibilities to ensure cities have access to the services they need, without being forced to stretch property taxes to cover essential costs.<br><br>

That’s why we’ve committed to uploading the costs of the Ottawa LRT, ensuring cities have the resources to focus on local priorities, including transit. Municipalities should have the flexibility to determine how they invest in their communities—transit should be an integral part of that, but the province needs to take on its fair share of responsibility instead of offering Band-Aid solutions.<br><br>

As your MPP, I’ll fight to ensure Waterloo Region has the resources and autonomy to build the transit system we deserve—not just temporary funding, but a real commitment to sustainable, long-term support.</td>
