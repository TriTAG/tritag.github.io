The Rapid Transit vote is only three weeks away. Make sure you have your opinion heard!

If you haven't done so, [add your comments](https://rapidtransit.region.waterloo.on.ca/comment.html) online to the final round of [public consultations](https://rapidtransit.region.waterloo.on.ca/public-meeting-materials.html) by **May 27**.

This Thursday, May 26, Kitchener City Council (which is not voting on Rapid Transit) will hold [a public meeting](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/insidecityhall/Rapid_Transit_Meeting.asp) about the subject. If you live or do business in Kitchener, please consider speaking there.

On May 31 and June 1, Regional Council (which is the body making the decision) will hold public meetings about Rapid Transit. The registration deadline to be added to the agenda is May 26 at noon. More information is [at the project website](https://rapidtransit.region.waterloo.on.ca/news/join-the-conversation.html).

And at the risk of repetition: Write a letter to the editor in any (or every!) local paper about LRT. [Write to your Regional Councillors](https://tritag.ca/m/lrt/). And on June 11, plan to attend [Rally for Rails II](https://lrtrally.ca/)!
