Waterloo Region has a position open for "[Manager, Rapid Transit Community Relations](https://ats.region.waterloo.on.ca/region/job_opportunities_ext_details_es.php?REQN_NUMBER=2012-1138)" ([main job site](https://regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/joblist.asp)), and we're linking it here because effective communication with the public and numerous stakeholders is one of the most important aspects of the LRT project's success. If you have the necessary background and care about effective transit, growth management, and reurbanization, please consider applying.

Oh, and the perhaps also important position of LRT Project Director is now available (no listing). As is this interesting (and new?) position of ["Coordinator, On-Street Passenger Amenities"](https://ats.region.waterloo.on.ca/region/job_opportunities_ext_details_es.php?REQN_NUMBER=2012-1123) for Grand River Transit.
