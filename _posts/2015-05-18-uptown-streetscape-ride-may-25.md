*Proposed Uptown Streetscape cross-section*

After many years of planning, the City of Waterloo will be making a decision on the future design for Uptown King Street on May 25. The [recommended design](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/uptownstreetscapeimprovement.asp) includes wider sidewalks with more space for seating, trees, and other amenities, improvements to the road design to make driving better, and, for the first time in Waterloo, [protected bike lanes](https://tritag.ca/bikeuptown/) separated from traffic by raised curbs and parked cars.

To celebrate this milestone for Uptown, and to support the recommended design, the Tri-Cities Transport Action Group and [WaterlooBikes.ca](https://waterloobikes.ca) are organizing a [community bike ride](https://www.facebook.com/events/982325525131361/) through Uptown Waterloo. We'll be gathering in the Public Square around 5:45pm on May 25, and bike up King Street where the protected bike lanes are proposed, circling back to City Hall to join the council meeting beginning at 6:30pm.

The proposed design has lots of support - from staff, elected representatives, many of the [Uptown businesses](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/contentresources/resources/living/King_streetscape_appendix_9a_Public_Consultation.pdf), and [over 1000 petitioners](https://www.change.org/p/city-of-waterloo-region-of-waterloo-we-need-segregated-bicycle-lanes-on-king-street-uptown-to-university), and is further encouraged by a [study of travel modes and spending habits](/blog/2015/03/27/report-finds-cycling-contributes-to-economic-vitality-of-uptown-waterloo/) in Uptown.  However, the more encouragement City Council receives for this project from the community, the more likely they will be to continue expanding the active transportation network with infrastructure of this high level of quality.

We hope to see you in Uptown next Monday.
