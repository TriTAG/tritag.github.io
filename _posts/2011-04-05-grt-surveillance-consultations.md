Last year, GRT [began installing cameras](https://www.therecord.com/news/article/292159--cameras-coming-to-grand-river-transit-buses) on buses for security purposes. Due to privacy and other concerns about the lack of a policy about storage and usage of recorded material, turning them on [was postponed](https://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/319047--privacy-concerns-delay-cameras-on-buses) until a policy was written. In February, Regional staff brought forward a [report](https://region.waterloo.on.ca/web/region.nsf/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce/6068F907B89372608525783400539942/$file/E-11-025.pdf?openelement) and a [draft policy](https://region.waterloo.on.ca/web/region.nsf/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce/6068F907B89372608525783400539942/$file/GRTPOLICY.pdf?openelement) on "Onboard Mobile Surveillance Systems". Planning & Works Committee had concerns, but approved the policy in principle, with the stipulation that the public be consulted. (See that meeting's [minutes](https://region.waterloo.on.ca/web/region.nsf/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce/60a289e256b6e0a48525783b00500e99!OpenDocument).)

There was some material on surveillance at last week's consultation centres on GRT service improvements, but no material was on the website and no prior notice was given that this information would be presented.

We have recently found out that GRT is holding [public consultations this week](https://grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/$All/B346999EEDB409A38525784F006A3520?OpenDocument), about which there has again been little notice. There will be one tomorrow at Ainslie Street Terminal in Cambridge, and one Thursday at 150 Frederick Street in Kitchener. If you cannot make one of those, please [review the details of the draft policy and submit comments](https://grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/$All/AF5301AD645E4D8C8525736100524862?OpenDocument) this week on your thoughts or concerns.

Later this week we will post our thoughts on the surveillance, but at this point we are very concerned that audio/video surveillance is moving forward with insufficient attention to privacy concerns and inadequate public consultation.
