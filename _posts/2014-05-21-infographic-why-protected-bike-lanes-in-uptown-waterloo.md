King Street in Uptown Waterloo  is being redesigned, and due to [popular demand](https://www.change.org/en-CA/petitions/city-of-waterloo-region-of-waterloo-we-need-segregated-bicycle-lanes-on-king-street-uptown-to-university), [protected bike lanes are now being considered](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/4530155-king-street-bike-lanes-could-displace-parking/) as an option for the blocks between Erb and Central.

TriTAG is supportive of protected bike infrastructure because it can make bicycling an attractive choice to most people. This is a once in a generation opportunity to make Uptown a truly walkable and bikable place. But businesses have concerns about changes to the Uptown streetscape, so we've created an [infographic](/images/protected-bike-lane-infographic.png) to help understand the benefits and trade-offs of protected lanes.<!--more-->

One of the best ways to voice your opinion on protected bike lanes and the Uptown streetscape redesign is to attend the [public consultation](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/contentresources/resources/business/Communications_proofed_May_2014_newsletter.pdf) on May 29th from 5-8pm at Waterloo City Hall. You can also [contact your city and regional councillors](https://contact.tritag.ca/uptown), and let the Uptown businesses you love know that you want to be able to shop from them by bike.
