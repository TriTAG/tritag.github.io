It's election time in Waterloo Region, and it's getting a bit crazy out there. While many candidates are presenting strong ideas and platforms, a few opportunists have carved out a "cancel LRT" niche, and they're not afraid to kick the facts to the curbside to sell it. TriTAG is calling them out.

If you've been following us for a while, you'll know that TriTAG has supported ION as a good plan to bring rapid transit to Waterloo Region. But we have also challenged the project team to make ION even better, sometimes being sharply critical of some decisions they have made. TriTAG wants to see ION be the best it can be: light rail will bring a lot of change to our cities, and will bring real transportation choice to many thousands of people. We have to get it right.

But change naturally has some voters concerned, and a few politicians are trying to cash in with single-issue campaigns designed to play up to people's fears. That's where we come in. TriTAG is going to put the myths being spread during this election to the test, to help you make your vote an informed one.

We hope you'll join us.
