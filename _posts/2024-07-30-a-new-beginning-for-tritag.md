It's been a few years since TriTAG was last active. Since then, the first phase of ION was launched, local bike lane standards have gotten better, and various pathways and crossings got upgrades. But there's a lot of work still to be done to make Waterloo Region a place where walking, biking, and transit are great ways for most people to get around.

Behind the scenes, we've started working on identifying priority advocacy areas, updating organizational approach, and replacing our website. We'll have more to share in the coming weeks, but for now we're excited to be back in the game!
