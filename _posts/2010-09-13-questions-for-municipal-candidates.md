Municipal election season is starting up. Later this week we will be sending out questionnaires on transportation issues to candidates for Regional Council and the three City Councils. We'd like to hear your ideas for questions! Let us know in comments below, or by [email](https://www.tritag.ca/about/contact/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tritag), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TriTAG).
