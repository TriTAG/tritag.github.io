We need your help and creativity. There's a development proposal in Waterloo right by a planned LRT station. It's for a second tower on the block bounded by Caroline, Allen, Park, and John streets, in addition to the one currently under construction at the corner of Park and Allen. (Details of the submission are [here](https://waterloo.ca/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=3125), along with [slides from a recent meeting](https://waterloo.ca/Portals/57ad7180-c5e7-49f5-b282-c6475cdb7ee7/DS_DEVAPPROV_documents/155ParkPP.pdf).). Apart from the egregious planned amount of parking either required by the city or desired by the developer at what should be a transit-oriented development, there is a bigger issue. The developer wants to build on top of the current Iron Horse Trail and replace it off to the side, lengthening it and making it worse as a transportation corridor. Chris Klein has [written about](https://waterloons.blogspot.ca/2012/04/sanctity-of-trails.html) the need to think carefully before trading away a main transportation corridor for a developer's benefit. But more on that later.

Here's where you come in. We want to see what ideas people have for how to develop this parcel and make the Iron Horse Trail _better_ at the same time -- by bringing it back to the original rail corridor alignment and taking out the current 90-degree turn. This is what I mean:

Let us know in the comments or email us your depictions (or examples from elsewhere) of what could be done with that area, perhaps with some creative use of the space above the Iron Horse Trail. We don't have much time to get this out to the developer and Waterloo City Hall, so e-mail us your ideas or examples to protectthetrail@tritag.ca . We'll put up the submissions in a follow-up.
