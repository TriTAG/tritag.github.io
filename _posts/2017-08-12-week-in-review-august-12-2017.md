## Fall transit schedule coming

[Grand River Transit's fall service starts September 4](https://www.grt.ca/en/service-updates/service-updates.aspx). But remember, the 4th is a holiday, so it'll still be crappy Sunday service that day. Real frequency improvements start on the 5th, with 201 and 202 routes increasing to 10 minute headways at peak times. The 7 will return to King Street in Midtown, while the 200 moves to Park Street.

## Bike share

The local municipalities are looking to Hamilton for ideas on the Region's [next bike sharing system](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7494801-beefing-up-bikeshare/). Hamilton's bike sharing model is one well worth emulating. It's well-used and growing, providing convenient transportation to thousands. Contrast with the local CAB system, which has fewer members than bikes.
