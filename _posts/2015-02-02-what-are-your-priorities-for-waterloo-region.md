The Region is collecting public input for its 2015-18 Strategic Plan and conducting a service review. The choices made over the next few years regarding transit, active transportation, and land use planning will be important to the success of ION light rail and the livability of your community. This is your opportunity to weigh in and help shape the Region's direction and investments.

The Region has set up a website called [Strat Chat](https://stratchat.regionofwaterloo.ca/) to collect input. On it, you can comment on or rate ideas, or suggest your own for topics such as [transportation](https://stratchat.regionofwaterloo.ca/transportation), [your vision for the Region](https://stratchat.regionofwaterloo.ca/topics/7396/life-in-waterloo-region-your-vision), [services that you feel merit greater investment](https://stratchat.regionofwaterloo.ca/topics/7464/service-review-investment), and many more.

One idea shared on the site that we'd hope you'd consider supporting is [greater investment in frequent transit](https://stratchat.regionofwaterloo.ca/ideas/56710/frequent-transit-network). This would make transit a more reliable transportation choice and increase ridership ahead of ION service. On snowy days like today, you may also want to consider whether having [municipally cleared sidewalks](https://stratchat.regionofwaterloo.ca/ideas/56810/municipally-cleared-sidewalks) is a good idea.
