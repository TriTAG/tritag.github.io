This weekend, people all over the world will lead [Jane’s Walks](https://www.janeswalk.org/) to showcase their communities. These walks can teach you about the history of your neighbourhood, show you the hidden beauty that you speed past every day, or open up new opportunities to enjoy you city. In KW, there will be some great walks run by your neighbours, community groups, and civic leaders.

Here are a few that TriTAG noticed, showing off some transportation possibilities and problems in this region.

[Shortcuts and Poetry All Around](https://www.janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/shortcuts-and-poetry-all-around/): In downtown Kitchener, Janice Lee will show off some of her favourite walking shortcuts. There are hidden gems inside parks and along paths that you might never see if you don’t get off your bike or out of your car! This walk starts on Sunday at 3pm.  

[Vehicular Architecture and Parking Policy](https://www.janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo/vehicular-architecture-and-parking-policy-uptown-waterloo/): In uptown Waterloo, TriTAG’s Michael Druker explores the current parking situation and the governing decisions around parking in the city. Do you think there is too much parking uptown, or too little? The walk starts on Saturday at 2pm.  

[Walking and Cycling Challenges and Opportunities](https://www.janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo/wacat-walk-waterloo-advisory-committee-active-transportation/): Also in Waterloo, Councillor Angela Vieth and Anne Crowe of the Waterloo Advisory Committee on Active Transportation (WACAT) will examine some of the current cycling and pedestrian routes around uptown. You might find new routes, or learn how our streets could be better designed to help cyclists and pedestrians get around. Join them on Sunday at 2pm. There are many more Jane’s Walks, and more are added to the website every day. Check out the full list of [Waterloo walks](https://www.janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo/) and [Kitchener walks](https://www.janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener), as well as a walk in [Cambridge](https://www.janeswalk.org/canada/cambridge) and one in [Elmira](https://www.janeswalk.org/canada/elmira).
