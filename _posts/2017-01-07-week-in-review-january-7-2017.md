## Transit

- Streetfilms showcases Seattle as "[America's next top transit city](https://transitcenter.org/2017/01/03/seattle-americas-next-top-transit-city/)" for their bold $50 billion investment in rail expansion to ensure the vast majority of its citizens live and work in proximity to rapid transit. The city is demonstrating a virtuous cycle of good planning and service, increasing ridership, and public support for further investments.
- A new study from the University of Montreal shows that [all-door boarding can decrease bus travel time](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/01/04/all-door-boarding-can-save-time-for-bus-riders-if-transit-agencies-embrace-it/) and increase passenger satisfaction.
- Transit advocate Steve Munro looks at the [impact that uneven headways have on transit wait times](https://stevemunro.ca/2016/12/31/calculating-the-effect-of-uneven-headways/). The crowding and bus-bunching effects he highlights can be observed on our own central transit corridor.
- GTA urbanist Andrea Griffith observes that portions of the Kitchener Line with GO bus service every 20 minutes may see a [decline in service quality if those relatively frequent buses are replaced by hourly trains](https://www.instagram.com/p/BOu1K4sghak/). Frequency is freedom.
- CityLab writer Tanvi Misra looks at how immigrants in America have been among the most loyal transit riders - [but their ridership is now in decline](https://www.citylab.com/commute/2017/01/the-newest-americans-getting-off-the-bus/512048/).
- The Region has updated its bylaws to [prohibit parking on light rail tracks](https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/News/index.aspx?newsId=97b3e80e-b6d6-48fa-a91c-d718ccced754).

## Vision Zero

- Halifax celebrates a [year without pedestrian or cyclist deaths](https://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2017/01/02/zero-pedestrian-and-cyclist-fatalities-in-2016.html). The regional municipality is roughly the same size as Waterloo Region.
- In New York, the State Court of Appeal [finds the city liable for failing to study and implement traffic calming measures](https://www.transalt.org/news/releases/9832) in the case of a child on a bike being seriously injured by a speeding driver. The ruling could have a major impact on how cities address road safety concerns.
- Kitchener staff recommend [maintaining the traffic calming measures installed on Glasgow](https://kitchener.ca.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&event_id=382&meta_id=37598) in 2014-15.
- Robin Mazumder goes on a tweetstorm about the [danger of slips on uncleared sidewalks](https://twitter.com/i/moments/817062467163525121) and the devastating effects a broken hip has on one's quality of life.

## Cycling

- Vancouver gets praise for its great side street bikeways, but People for Bikes notes that [protected bike lanes on main streets in conjunction with bikeways on quiet streets are a powerful combination for growing bike ridership](https://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/side-street-bikeways-are-great-if-you-have-protected-bike-lanes-too).
- TCAT publishes a [study](https://www.tcat.ca/knowledge-centre/bike-lanes-on-street-parking-and-business_-a-study-of-queen-street-west-in-torontos-parkdale-neighbourhood/) of Toronto's Queen Street West, in the Parkdale neighbourhood. It finds 72% of shoppers arrive by active transportation, only 4% arriving regularly by car. In spite of this, merchants tend to overestimate the number of customers arriving by car.
- The Waterloo Chronicle covers [upcoming changes to the Columbia/Lexington corridor](https://www.waterloochronicle.ca/news-story/7046204-building-a-better-east-west-link-in-waterloo/), including separated cycling lanes to the west, and a pathway to cross Highway 85 on the east side.
- The City of Waterloo's heritage blog covers the history of [King and Erb](https://waterlooheritage.com/2016/06/01/160-years-of-change-at-the-corner-of-king-and-erb/), noting its future as a protected bike lane corridor.
- As of January 1, [people cycling are now allowed to ride side-by-side on Regional roads](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7053878-side-by-side-cycling-legal-in-region/). Most other municipalities are expected to follow suit, but Wellesley and Wilmot are likely to refuse to do so.

## Ride-hailing and autonomous vehicles

- City Observatory produces a [scathing commentary of popular claims about the wonders of shared autonomous vehicles](https://cityobservatory.org/pollyannas-ride-sharing-breakthrough/), especially of a recent study that claims ride-sharing apps can cut traffic by 85%. Don't be beguiled by flashy technology, hype, and the glossing over of hard facts like geometry and induced demand.
- UW researchers are finding that it's [really hard for autonomous vehicles to drive in icy and snowy conditions](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/self-driver-error-tests-show-some-cold-snowy-facts-about-self-driving-vehicles/article33487193/). (It's kind of hard for humans too...) Not only do the slippery conditions pose a stability problem, but piles of snow and reduced visibility can make it harder for vehicles to find their positions on the roadway.
- Meanwhile, [automakers are resigning themselves to the fact that the age of the personal car is coming to a close](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7037918-automakers-prepare-for-an-america-that-s-over-the-whole-car-thing/), by investing in last-mile transit, ride-sharing, and autonomous vehicles.

## Planning and parking

- Buffalo is now the first major US city to [eliminate parking minimums](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/01/03/buffalo-becomes-first-major-city-to-eliminate-damaging-parking-rules/), which should make transit-oriented development more feasible and affordable. Will our cities do the same to help spur ION's success from day one?
- Brent Toderian writes about how [good math can help address common misconceptions about planning](https://www.metronews.ca/views/opinion/2017/01/03/math-myth-busting-our-worst-urban-planning-misconceptions.html) - like how people who bike really do pay their own way or how compact development saves cities money.
- Cheris Burda, executive director of the Ryerson City Building Institute says [it's time to stop blaming the Greenbelt and provincial land use policy for the cost of housing](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/stop-blaming-the-greenbelt-for-housing-prices/article33450009/) in the GTHA.
