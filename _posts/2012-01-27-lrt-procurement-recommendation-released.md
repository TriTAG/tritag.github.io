The Region has released its [staff report recommending an LRT procurement strategy](https://rapidtransit.region.waterloo.on.ca/pdfs/2012_RECOMMENDED_STAGE_1_LRT_PROCUREMENT__DELIVERY_OPTION.pdf), which will determine the approach used to design, build, and operate the system. More specifically, it recommends a public-private partnership, with extensive private sector responsibility. See [the report](https://rapidtransit.region.waterloo.on.ca/pdfs/2012_RECOMMENDED_STAGE_1_LRT_PROCUREMENT__DELIVERY_OPTION.pdf) for full details.

On Tuesday, January 31, at 2pm, Deloitte (the Region's consultant) will be giving a presentation at a special meeting ([see agenda](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/PA2012-0131P2.pdf)) on the recommendation and its basis. The following Tuesday, February 7, at 6pm will be the [public meeting on LRT procurement](https://regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/Advertisement-PWFeb72012.pdf). Regional Council will make the final decision on February 8.
