## Cycling

Following the release of 2016 census journey to work data [last month](/blog/2017/12/04/week-in-review-december-4-2017/), more ink has been spilled on what to do about stagnant local cycling mode share numbers. Mike Farwell set aside his recent cycling antagonism to put forward a surprising column that asks [how we can make our cycling investments more strategic](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/opinion-story/7978550-the-car-is-still-king-in-waterloo-region/). James Howe and UW planning professor Brian Doucet respond to other commentary to [call for physically separated cycling infrastructure](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/7985651-how-to-get-more-people-on-bikes/) and point out that [the important differences between Waterloo Region and bike-friendly places like Amsterdam and Copenhagen are the result of political choices](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/7987622-we-can-build-better-more-people-centred-cities/) (that we can change!), not geographic luck.

Fortunately, the winds of change may be blowing. The Region hopes to replicate the recent successes of the Calgary and Edmonton downtown cycle track pilots with a [separated bike lane pilot of its own around Uptown and Northdale](https://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/separated-bike-lane-pilot-waterloo-region-1.4433310). Consultations on the pilot take place December [12](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/separated-bike-lane-pilot-project-public-consultation-centre-tickets-40885218790?aff=es2) and [14](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/separated-bike-lane-pilot-project-public-consultation-centre-tickets-40905548597?aff=es2).

The province has also announced [$4 million in funding for cycling infrastructure](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7980045-region-gets-millions-from-province-for-cycling-infrastructure/) this year for the Region, the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo, and [Wilmot](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7986079-wilmot-gets-107k-to-boost-cycling-infrastructure/). The money comes from revenues from the province's carbon emissions cap and trade program.

## Transit

Light rail vehicle 504 has now arrived in Waterloo Region:

Light rail costs have [increased by $50 million](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7988212-light-rail-construction-cost-jumps-50m/), due in part to Bombardier's delays and construction variations. Fortunately, increased provincial support, new development charges, and project contingencies mean property taxes shouldn't be affected. The Region also hopes to be able to go after Bombardier for costs associated with their delays.

Kitchener-Waterloo MPP Catherine Fife successfully brought [forward a motion last week to have the government give specific financial and timeline commitments for two-way all-day GO service to Waterloo Region](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4438432?__twitter_impression=true).

## Walking

The Social Development Centre Waterloo Region has shared [presentation boards](https://www.waterlooregion.org/consultation-traynor-fairway-crossing-alternative-locations) from Kitchener's consultation on the Traynor-Fairway pedestrian connection. Staff appear to be favouring a level crossing solution. Feedback is due December 22.
