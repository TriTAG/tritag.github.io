As of the beginning of July, Google Maps now offers directions for travel in Waterloo Region by Grand River Transit. GRT joins agencies like GO Transit, Guelph Transit, and Hamilton Street Railway in allowing trip planning just by typing an origin and destination into Google Maps and clicking the "by public transit" train icon.

If you've wanted something that works better on your mobile phone than [EasyGO](https://192.237.29.245/hastinfoweb/), that has a better user interface, and that provides more options for your trip -- well, this may give you what you're looking for. Below is a sample trip from east Kitchener to Preston.

We believe Grand River Transit will be publishing their transit schedule data in a [standard format](https://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html) within a matter of weeks, which will open up some exciting possibilities for app development.
