## Parking

Parking demand is falling, and [will eventually evaporate in urban areas](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/parking-real-estate-uban-planning-1.4221365). So why are our cities still requiring it everywhere?

In their draft zoning bylaws, both [Kitchener](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/insidecityhall/resources/PLAN_CROZBY_B_Section-5.pdf) and [Waterloo](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/contentresources/resources/business/ZBR2_section6_parking_and_loading.pdf) make some modest parking requirement reductions around transit stations, but still would require copious amounts of parking elsewhere. The drafts also don't seem to acknowledge the fact that the Ontario government has pledged to [eliminate parking minimums as part of its climate change action plan](https://www.ontario.ca/page/climate-change-action-plan#section-6).
