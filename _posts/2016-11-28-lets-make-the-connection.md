Last week, we talked about the gap in transit planning around ION and the 202 University Avenue iXpress. [Click here to read the details](/blog/2016/11/24/missing-the-ion-connection/). The Waterloo Region Record has also published a [story](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/6987503-busy-university-express-bus-not-linked-to-lrt-plaza/), and we'll be on [CBC radio](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo) Tuesday morning at 7:40 to discuss it.

How can you help ensure that connections are in place for ION and GRT iXpress buses on University Avenue in time for 2018?

- [Give GRT your feedback](https://www.grt.ca/en/aboutus/uwaterloo-transit-station.asp)! Follow that link to learn about the UW transit plaza and find a link to submit your feedback. Tell GRT you want them to live up to their key priority of building seamless connections to ION light rail.

- Tell the University of Waterloo what you think. [Contact the president's office](https://uwaterloo.ca/president/about/people) and explain that UW needs to step up and help our community get maximum value for our transit money, rather than obstructing good transit access to ION. Let the 202 pass!

- Student or alumnus of UW? [Contact the UW Feds](https://www.feds.ca/contact-us/) and tell them you want the University to work with GRT, not against them, in order to make your own transit experience along University Avenue better.

With your help, we can make the connection.
