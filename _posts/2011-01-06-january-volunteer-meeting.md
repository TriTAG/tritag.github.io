_This entry has been updated for a 7:00pm start. We will also be joined by UW planning professor Jeff Casello._

If you're interested in helping out with what TriTAG is doing, come out to our first regular volunteer meeting. We'll bring you up to speed on the issues and what needs to be done. Main issue will be light rail, but there are others as well.

**The meeting will be at [Whole Lot-A Gelata](https://www.wholelotagelata.com/) in Waterloo on Tuesday, January 18, from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.** (Facebook event is [here](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=124030240996249).) You are welcome to come earlier to have time to get some coffee or gelato.

We plan to hold volunteer meetings monthly.
