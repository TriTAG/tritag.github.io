### Update: ION station buttons are now available from our [online store](https://store.tritag.ca)!

### Show your support for light rail and your neighbourhood pride

You’ve seen the construction, the tracks getting put in the ground, the stations falling into place.

At TriTAG, we’re excited to soon be able to get around town with rapid, frequent transit service. For the last six years, we’ve been advocating for more transit, protected bikeways, and better walking conditions to our cities to make our communities great places to work and live.

We want you to share your excitement for the transformation happening in our Region, while helping us to take our efforts to the next level.

We’re creating buttons for each stop along the ION light rail route. Inspired by the anchor wall designs, these buttons will feature a unique pattern for each ION station, letting you show off your neighbourhood pride. We’re giving these buttons as ‘perks’ for your support of [our Indiegogo campaign](https://igg.me/at/tritag). You can get the whole set, or special collections featuring different neighbourhoods and places along ION.

We're looking to raise $5,000 to continue TriTAG's advocacy efforts through incorporation as a not-for-profit and better engagement with the Waterloo Region community.
