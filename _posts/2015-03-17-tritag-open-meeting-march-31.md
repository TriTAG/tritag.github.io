If you're interested in talking about Waterloo Region walking, biking, and transit, please join us for an informal gathering on [Tuesday, March 31 at the Barley Works (upstairs of the Huether Hotel in Uptown), between 6:30pm and 9:00pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/1550070478593205/).

We'd love to have you join us and share your ideas concerning local transportation issues. This is also a great opportunity to ask us about the work TriTAG is doing or how to get involved. Hope to see you there!
