## Snowed

After initially supporting a winter sidewalk maintenance pilot exploring proactive enforcement and plowing options in committee, [Kitchener Council flip-flopped](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/kitchener-snow-clearing-1.4721997) in the wee hours of Tuesday morning and voted 7-4 to not consider any plowing options this year. Shockingly, Councillor Galloway-Sealock, who moved the deferral, [implied that she was discounting the opinions of residents who supported the pilot as unrepresentative](https://twitter.com/danbrotherston/status/1011682370251100160), as if sharing TriTAG's position was somehow disqualifying. Fortunately, your opinions can't be so easily discounted at the ballot box October 22.

- Thank Mayor Vrbanovic and Councillors Marsh, Fernandes, and Gazzola for their steady support of the pilot.
- Does Kitchener City Hall belong in the snow business? ([The Record](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/8682198-the-record-s-view-does-kitchener-city-hall-belong-in-snow-business-/))

## Transit

GRT has published [ridership numbers for May](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/performance-measures.aspx) - we've now had 10 consecutive months of higher ridership than the year before! The average year over year increase is 3.4%. GRT has also published new performance measures including overcrowding and missed service hours (due to collisions, mechanical failures, weather, etc.)
