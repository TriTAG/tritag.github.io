This Sunday the city of Waterloo will be closing King Street to cars between Erb and Union Streets from 11am to 3pm, opening it up for people to enjoy and hosting a number of events in that space as well. There will be four such Sundays this year, and Kitchener plans to join the party -- making it really "square2square" -- [only on July 17th](https://waterloo.openfile.ca/waterloo/file/2011/05/car-free-sundays-coming-june-19). The event has a [website](https://square2square.ca/) and an organizational/informational [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_215598541784633). If you can help out, the organizers are still looking for [volunteers](https://square2square.ca/volunteer.html).

Please come out to Waterloo's first Car-free Sunday and tell everyone you know to come! Success of the first one will help increase momentum and business support for the upcoming ones - perhaps we could eventually see [businesses pushing for car-free spaces](https://bikeportland.org/2011/03/24/downtown-businesses-push-for-carfree-sw-ankeny-street-50189) here. The event is important symbolically as a conscious step towards reclaiming the streets as a place first and foremost for people and not just for cars.

We also invite you to join some of TriTAG and others on a stylish ride down King Street to celebrate the first Car-free Sunday. We'll meet around 11:30am on Sunday, June 19th at the north end of the car-free area in Waterloo (King & Erb), and ride south/east to downtown Kitchener. Around noon we'll head out from the Kitchener City Hall plaza for a tour of several of Kitchener's cafes. Attire: nice street clothes - not spandex! If you've got an old 3-speed in the back of the garage, now's the time to haul it out. There is a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=206099886099930) as well.
