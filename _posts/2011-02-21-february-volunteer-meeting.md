If you’re interested in helping out with what TriTAG is doing and would like to know what we're working on, you're invited to our volunteer meeting tomorrow. The meeting will be at [Whole Lot-A Gelata](https://www.wholelotagelata.com/) in Waterloo on Tuesday, February 22, from 6:30pm to 8:30pm. (Facebook event is [here](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=196338757051986).)

We haven't yet set up a calendar for TriTAG events, but hope to do that soon.
