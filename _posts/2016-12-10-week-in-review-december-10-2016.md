## Walking in a winter not so wonderland

- Following staff advice, Kitchener council votes unanimously [against pursuing winter sidewalk plowing in 2017](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/news-story/7007593-keep-your-shovel-handy/).
- Record columnist Luisa D'Amato [decries the decision](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/7006853-d-amato-clear-walks-are-a-right-city-should-pay-to-clean/), calling safe sidewalks "a human right we can't afford to ignore." Meanwhile, the Record's editorial board, despite calling the projected $26/household cost a "bargain," [applauds council for penny-pinching](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/7008667-clean-your-walk-save-on-taxes/).
- TriTAG [questions the Kitchener report's dependence on complaints](/blog/2016/12/09/snowed-in-with-bad-metrics/) to measure the effectiveness of the sidewalk shovelling bylaw. As a result, we're developing new metrics, with which we'd like to measure the state of mobility and safety on our sidewalks this winter (with your help!)
- Robin Mazumder invites planners and policy makers try to n[avigate the cities they design on foot to find empathy](https://robinmazumder.com/2016/12/08/put-yourself-in-our-shoes-using-empathy-to-build-walkable-cities/) for the people who must walk its streets everyday.
- The arrival of snow presents an opportunity to see to [what extent space on the road is wasted](https://www.insidescience.org/news/it’s-snow-joke-experts-say-town-planners-need-do-better) by where tire tracks are and aren't. Excess road space makes for higher traffic speeds and more dangerous pedestrian crossings.

- The next [Winter Cycling Congress](https://www.velo.qc.ca/wcc/?lang=en), February 8-10 in Montreal, has published its program and opened registrations. Meanwhile, snowy Finland sets a national goal to [increase its cycling mode share to 30% by 2030](https://ecf.com/slide/finland-sets-national-goal-increase-number-trips-made-bicycle-30-year-2030).

## Transit

- [Bombardier completes its new Kingston facility](https://www.thewhig.com/2016/12/08/bombardier-completes-expansion) for building ION light rail vehicles.
- [ION director Darshpreet Bhatti is leaving the Region for Metrolinx](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7009028-region-s-lrt-director-leaving-for-metrolinx/) at the end of the year, which should make a much shorter commute for the Brampton resident.
- The Region wins a prestigious [Brownie Award](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7002186-region-receives-brownie-award-for-rapid-transit-project/), for the host of brownfield developments ION is spurring along the transit corridor.
- The University of Waterloo administration responds to the claim that they're acting as an impediment to connectivity between ION and the 202 iXpress, stating they have "[different opinions](https://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/university-bus-lrt-ion-waterloo-1.3879134)" on where transit stops should be located. Sorry UW, but it's not a matter of opinion, its a matter of facts on the ground: the ION stop is fixed in place.
- Transit naysayer and columnist Peter Shawn Taylor thinks [driverless cars will spell the death of transit](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/7008056-future-shock-will-driverless-cars-make-lrt-obsolete-/). Mr. Taylor should familiarize himself with TransitCenter's list of [key arguments](https://transitcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FactSheet_Final.compressed.pdf) of what Uber and driverless cars can't replace and why transit is here to stay.
- Streetfilms puts out a new [video](https://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/12/vancouver-is-north-americas-car-free-capital/509480/) showing how Vancouver got to 50% "active transit" mode share - in other words, fewer than half of all trips are by car:

## Vision Zero

- It's been a [terrible week for cars running down pedestrians](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/twenty-four-pedestrians-hit-by-cars-in-toronto-in-one-day/article33238720/) in Toronto, and to add insult to injury, it seems the [penalty for killing a pedestrian](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/what-is-a-fit-penalty-when-a-driver-takes-a-pedestrians-life/article33236677/) is just $1000, 6 months probation, and a few driving restrictions.
- Toronto is also [hiring a new transportation director](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/12/09/new-transportation-boss-says-car-is-no-longer-king.html) from Seattle, who says the car is no longer king. When will Waterloo Region have this kind of leadership?
- [Impaired driving continues to plague our streets](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/news-story/7007753-despite-public-awareness-drivers-continue-to-get-behind-the-wheel-while-impaired/), with drugs becoming an increasing problem. Meanwhile, a columnist for the Victoria Times Colonist reminds us that [freak-outs over distracted walking distract from the real dangers on the road](https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/monique-keiran-distracted-walking-not-the-real-problem-1.3656580).
- "Slow down, children at play" signs are often scoffed at for being ineffective. But Dylan Reid notes they do have a subtle impact on driver behaviour, but more importantly [build support for and remind councillors of the need to build safer streets](https://spacing.ca/toronto/2016/12/08/slow-signs-actually-work/).

## Mandatory parking

- While transit fares remain as high as ever, [Waterloo is making two more parking lots free in Uptown](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7004733-waterloo-ok-s-free-parking-at-two-core-lots/).
- Meanwhile, Waterloo's ION station area plans are getting [pushback from certain developers](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7009073-rules-will-change-to-help-get-lrt-development-city-wants/) who aren't on board with the idea that auto-oriented land uses aren't appropriate near light rail.
- Elsewhere, [Seattle has been allowing apartments without parking](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-builds-lots-of-new-apartments-but-not-so-many-parking-spots/) to make downtown housing more affordable, leading to big modal shifts. Boston is testing [surge pricing for parking](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2016/12/01/4-an-hour-to-park-boston-to-test-parking-meter.html) to manage demand and time spent searching for parking. And Sidewalk Labs writes about how [shared parking lots](https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/how-shared-parking-can-improve-city-life-3f4ce1c83dd9) between multiple uses and peak use times, with the help of technology, can reduce the feeling of downtown being pitted with empty parking lots.
