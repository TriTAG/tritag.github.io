If you're interested in talking about Waterloo Region walking, biking, and transit, please join us at our pub night on Monday, February 24 at the Huether Hotel, between 6:30pm and 9:00pm ([Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1386860458249913/)). We'll also be discussing ION rapid transit and what support is needed as it comes to its biggest milestone.

BarleyWorks is upstairs as you enter the Huether Hotel ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Huether+Hotel/@43.4669745,-80.5230948,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x882bf40ce0834e6d:0xa10f9861d1d26e1a)), and we'll be on the second level of BarleyWorks in the large room at the back.
