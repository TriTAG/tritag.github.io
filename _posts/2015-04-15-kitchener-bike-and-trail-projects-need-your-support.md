The City of Kitchener is considering a number of trail and on-road cycling facility projects for 2015:

- Road diet with buffered bike lanes on Westheights Drive ([public consultation materials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7RB3odHSRv_SjZvOF9MQnM0N1E/view?usp=sharing))
- Road diet with bike lanes on Union Street from Lancaster to Margaret ([public consultation materials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7RB3odHSRv_LUxseDNhNkcyd2M/view?usp=sharing))
- Multi-use pathways along Kolb Greenway and Rothsay Ave
- Road diet with buffered bike lanes on East Ave ([public consultation materials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7RB3odHSRv_ZkM2VlhxcnI0R1U/view?usp=sharing))
- Multi-use pathways along Balzer Creek from Country Hill to Fallowfield ([public consultation Tuesday April 28](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=dWQ5bWwzaHRrdTByZGhwbXFuZzJobDNhYW8gdHJpdGFnLmNhX2NxcGNpaXN1dXQ5M211a3VlamY3dmM5bmZjQGc&ctz=America/Toronto))
- Island crossings for the Iron Horse Trail at Courtland and Stirling, with cycling facilities along Stirling from Charles to Mill

These projects, if completed this year, would implement important pieces in the cycling and trail networks for the City of Kitchener, but many have vocal opponents who could drown out the voices of those who want to enjoy better bike facilities and safer streets in these areas.

Members of Council and staff need to know these projects have public support. Please consider attending one of these public consultations and taking a few minutes to [write a letter of support to your councillors](https://contact.tritag.ca/bikekitchener/).
