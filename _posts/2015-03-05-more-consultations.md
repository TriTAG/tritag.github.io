## Growth Plan and Greenbelt Review

"The best transportation plan is a great land use plan." - Brent Toderian

How our communities are laid out has a profound impact on how we are able to get around: growing our cities up, not out, enables more people to choose to walk, bike, or take transit. Ontario is [reviewing its Greenbelt Plan and the Growth Plan](https://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page10882.aspx) and is hosting a town hall in Waterloo Region to gather your input. We encourage you to attend this event and urge the Province of Ontario to strengthen the tools our municipalities have to shape healthy growth.

**March 25** 6pm-7pm Open House 7pm-9pm Formal Meeting Bingeman's Conference Centre 425 Bingeman's Centre Drive, Kitchener [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/428642853959148/)

## Climate Change Plan

The province is also performing consultations in preparations for its [climate change plan](https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/climate-change-consultation#consultation). As enabling better transportation choices can improve carbon footprints, this is an opportunity to advocate for better active transportation and transit. A town hall to receive feedback is being held in Waterloo Region.

**March 19** 6-8pm Kitchener Public Library, Main Branch 68 Queen Street N, Kitchener [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/336382489902022/)

## Bill 31, Transportation Statute Law Amendment Act (Making Ontario’s Roads Safer), 2015

This bill contains a number of road safety improvements including a 1 metre passing rule, explicit permission for municipalities to build contra-flow bike lanes, and changes to pedestrian crossing rules. The bill is currently in committee, and will be reviewed on March 9 and 11. Details on how to present or submit written comments to the Standing Committee on General Government can be found here: [https://www.ontla.on.ca/committee-proceedings/committee-hearings-notices/files\_html/Bill%2031%20Ad%20-%20English.htm](https://www.ontla.on.ca/committee-proceedings/committee-hearings-notices/files_html/Bill%2031%20Ad%20-%20English.htm)
