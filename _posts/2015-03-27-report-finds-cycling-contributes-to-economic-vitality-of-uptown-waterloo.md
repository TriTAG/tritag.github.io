On Monday, City of Waterloo Council will be [receiving a report](https://calendar.waterloo.ca/Module/Calendar/Document/Download/3df9c15f-3fae-49cb-b048-cf6d37950380) from Professor Casello and Professor Moos of the University of Waterloo concerning the economic contributions of bicycle users to Uptown.

Key findings include:

- There is significant diversity in the modes of travel people use to shop or eat in Uptown - not everyone arrives by car.
- People who travel to shop by bike do so more frequently than those by car, and spend just as much overall.
- Lack of bike lanes, traffic, and limited bike parking are barriers to cycling Uptown, (for both cyclists and non-cyclists alike).

This study contributes to the already compelling [case for protected bike lanes on King Street](https://tritag.ca/bikeuptown). A street that is safe and welcoming to _all_ modes of travel would boost the economic vitality of the Uptown core.
