The Honourable Kathleen Wynne, Minister of Transportation 77 Wellesley St. W. Toronto, ON M7A 1Z8

**Re: Possible Toronto LRT project cancellations**

Minister Wynne,

While it is with concern that I read of possible LRT project cancellations in Toronto with the inauguration of Mayor Rob Ford, I would like to take the opportunity to identify a very deserving recipient of the Province of Ontario's infrastructure funding should Transit City indeed be cancelled.

As your government has already graciously funded Phase 1 of the Region of Waterloo's Rapid Transit project, as well as the expansion of GO Transit rail service to Kitchener, I humbly submit to you that Phase 2 of the Region of Waterloo's Light Rail Transit project, as well as GO expansion to the city of Cambridge, should be the first recipient of any moneys rejected by Mayor Ford.

<!--more-->Due to initial concerns about keeping Phase 1 of the Rapid Transit project within a scope the Region thought it could reasonably ask for multilevel government assistance with, the City of Cambridge has been left in Phase 2 without a firm timeline for LRT completion. It also presently lacks a connection to the GO Rail network via Milton. I ask that you consider rectifying what is perceived in Cambridge to be an inequity should the funds become available for you to do so.

I have copied the Mayor of Cambridge, its City Council, as well as other elected officials relevant to this discussion. I understand through the media that you have received similar communication from Mayor Hazel McCallion of Mississauga, and wish to make sure that Cambridge does not go unheard. We in the Region of Waterloo understand that Mayor Ford may wish to stop certain trains in Toronto, but should he wish to do so, there are other partners in the regional economy of Toronto and points east, west, and north who would be more than happy to take them off of his hands.

Thank you for your time, and warmest regards for this holiday season,
