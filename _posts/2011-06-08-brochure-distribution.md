We have about 7,000 brochures that need to get out the community before next Monday. Here is a map of what volunteers have covered so far: [https://goo.gl/maps/RVuG](https://goo.gl/maps/RVuG) . Can you put 100 in mailboxes around your neighbourhood? Do you live in a 200 unit apartment building? Please be in touch with us **\*now\*** at volunteer@tritag.ca ; brochures are available for pickup downtown near KPL main branch, or we can deliver to you between 8pm and 10pm on weeknights.
