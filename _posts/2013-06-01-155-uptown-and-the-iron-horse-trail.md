We've [written before](/blog/2012/06/18/preserving-integrity-of-iron-horse-trail/) about the 155 Uptown development proposal, which is a 19-storey condo tower plan predicated on the City of Waterloo agreeing to a land swap to move a portion of the Iron Horse Trail. Worryingly, the staff report indicates that the City of Waterloo considers the Iron Horse Trail to be a purely recreational facility.Â And while there have been a couple of neighbourhood meetings and committee consultation, the general trail-using public has not been consulted about this plan, and most are probably not even aware.

Now is the time to speak up (or send in your written comments), as the proposal is coming up for formal approvals at two meetings on Monday, June 10. Here's what you need to know:

[Planning documents](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/business/141145and155carolinestand156parkst.asp) for the development, as well as the staff report and recommendation.

[Disposition of the Iron Horse Trail property](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/news/index.aspx?FeedId=88cebce5-79f5-446e-8ca5-1142808bedd6&newsId=3cb81f26-7b56-4b06-8427-df3d7bca98c4) - formal meeting for the land swap decision on June 10.

[Zoning by-law amendment](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/News/index.aspx?newsId=20088833-e425-4898-a488-6ed806ba7bfc) - formal public meeting for development approval, on June 10.

[Contact for City Council](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/aboutmayorandcouncil.asp). Call or email councillors with your thoughts, in addition to providing comments through the formal meetings linked above.

We believe that land in close proximity to LRT stations should indeed be intensified, but [with less parking](https://waterloons.blogspot.ca/2013/05/pick-your-poison-waterloo.html), more active streetscapes, and more sensitivity to the surrounding transportation context than the current 155 Uptown plan. The City of Waterloo should not be making exceptions (and trading off public assets) to facilitate merely "transit-adjacent development", and instead should focus on making actually transit-oriented development.
