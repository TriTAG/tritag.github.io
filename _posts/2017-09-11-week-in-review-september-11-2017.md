## School zone

The Kitchener Post reports on local school board and municipal [efforts to increase walking to school](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/news-story/7531240-trail-blazing-the-movement-afoot/), as the province announces $4 million in funding for [walking school bus and bike to school programs](https://news.ontario.ca/edu/en/2017/09/improving-well-being-for-students-across-ontario.html).

Guelph is changing [speed limits in school zones to 30 km/h](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/guelph-reduce-traffic-speed-school-zones-1.4275498). Kitchener's school zones are only 40 km/h, which carries [nearly twice the risk of severe injury in a pedestrian collision](https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/2011PedestrianRiskVsSpeed.pdf) as 30 km/h impacts. Based on the response to past advocacy efforts of local community groups, the Region doesn't appear interested in changing speeds at all along Regional roads near schools.

## Moving forward

[Consultations](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/MovingForward.asp) resume next week on the update to the Region's Transportation Master Plan. As part of its work, the Region plans to study three scenarios: committed and planned projects (continuing the status quo), increased transit and active transportation, and potential futures with "new mobility" (autonomous cars, ride-hailing, etc).

## Transit

[Public consultations](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/public-consultations.aspx) for proposed [2018 transit route changes](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/2018-transit-network.aspx) begin next week. (Survey is also available [online](https://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/274/Issue_5366).) We note from the materials that there is still [no connection shown between the 202 University iXpress and ION](/blog/2016/11/24/missing-the-ion-connection/), or between the 202 and the rationalized route 7.

## Walking

The Social Development Centre Waterloo Region is seeking public feedback on [pedestrian access around ION](https://www.waterlooregion.org/call-out-pedestrian-feedback-on-ion). Kitchener appears poised to approve [traffic calming for Doon Mills Drive](https://kitchener.ca.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&event_id=423&meta_id=45315) that includes a raised crossing and narrowed intersections.

## Cycling

Continuing from the conversation about behaviour, infrastructure, and cycling safety over the [last few weeks](/blog/2017/09/05/week-in-review-september-5-2017/), Robin Mazumder shares [his thoughts](https://robinmazumder.com/2017/09/09/shame-blame-and-the-city-building-game-moving-forward-with-the-way-we-move/): _"Finger wagging at people who cycle to follow road rules in a city with no separated bike lanes is like telling someone to stay in their swim lane when they’re drowning in the pool."_ He invites ideas on how to best move forward with transforming local cycling infrastructure. TriTAG has something brewing in that regard, so stay tuned!
