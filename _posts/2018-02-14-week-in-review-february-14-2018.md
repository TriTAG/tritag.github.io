## Making space

How inclusive are our discussions of urban and transportation issues? [Melissa Bruntlett of Modacity](https://www.modacitylife.com/blog/making-space-for-diversity-in-the-urbanist-world) writes about the issues that can arise when advocacy becomes disproportionately dominated by the white, able-bodied, and male. She's challenging herself and others to make more space for those who aren't exactly like us, because our cities are made better when everyone is heard.

## By bike

Ontario is seeking feedback on its [#CycleON cycling strategy Action Plan 2.0](https://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTMzOTQ4&statusId=MjAzNzQ5&language=en). Our first skim-through of the plan revealed some promising commitments - like updating cycling facilities standards using best practices from elsewhere in the world and helping municipalities complete their portions of a provincial cycling network. We also found some things that need improvement, like a lack of funding to fix provincial highway crossings beyond the designated provincial cycling network, and labelling education and awareness campaigns that don't change fundamental road designs as "mak\[ing\] highways and streets safer."

- Based on the tally on the [Winter Bike to Work Day](https://winterbiketoworkday.org/map/#8/43.333/-80.689) website, at least 84 people in Waterloo Region braved the heavy snowfall to ride their bikes to work on Friday.

## Vision Zero

Kitchener is planning [traffic calming reviews](https://kitchener.ca.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=862&meta_id=48613) this year for Patricia Ave, McGarry Drive, and Old Chicopee Drive. West Ave and Stirling Ave S also ranked high on the traffic-calming priority list for the year, but these streets are candidates for a pedestrian crossover and bike lanes, respectively, which may mitigate some traffic issues.

## The road ahead

The province has shelved plans for a new 400-series "GTA West" highway, on the [advice of the Advisory Panel](https://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/gta-west-report/executive-summary.shtml) it had appointed to study the project. The panel, recognizing the reality of induced demand, found that congestion pricing would offer ten times as much time-savings as more highways could.
