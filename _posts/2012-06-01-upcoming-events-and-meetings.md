A number of things are happening in the next two weeks, which you shouldn't miss!

Next week is the [Commuter Challenge](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/commuterchallenge.asp), aimed at getting people to rethink their commutes. Check that link for details on all the constituent events. On Monday, June 4, is the launch event, which is also an open house and consultation for both the King/Victoria transit hub walking/cycling access plan and for the Region's active transportation master plan. If that weren't enough, there will be a presentation by Hans Moor on developing a cycling culture, including a discussion of the successful Dutch approach. The event is from 4:30pm to 8:00pm at the UW School of Pharmacy, with the presentation at 6pm. (It is not entirely clear whether the public consultation / open house continues through the presentation.) You should attend. More information is available [from the Region](https://regionofwaterloo.ca/en/newslist/index.aspx?corpId=58cynQlfgqiAYQyTLmpurQeQuAleQuAl&newsId=PUKONTlVFjQpabyudR3FqgeQuAleQuAl) and [from Sustainable Waterloo](https://www.sustainablewaterlooregion.ca/events/upcoming-events/); people are encouraged to [register](https://www.sustainablewaterlooregion.ca/event-registration/?evt_id=110).

The following week is the final one of three week-long public forums on the Central Transit Corridor development strategy. The topic for the week is how the LRT can strengthen existing aspects of the community. It will include two open houses, one in Cambridge and one in Kitchener. The first open house will be followed by a keynote talk by Sue Zielinski; if it's anything like the previous two, it is well worth attending. Details are in [this document](https://centraltransitcorridor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Opportunity-Forums_One-Pager.pdf); you can also check the [project website](https://centraltransitcorridor.ca/) as well as the storefront office by Kitchener City hall. There is a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/173522189444146/) for the talk that can help you spread the word.
