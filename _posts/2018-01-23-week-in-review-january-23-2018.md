## #snowbilityWR

Thanks to your help with our [sidewalk study](/blog/2018/01/04/winter-sidewalk-study/) last winter, and your continued efforts raising concerns with municipal leaders, [Kitchener appears poised to re-open the debate over how it keeps (or doesn't keep) its sidewalks cleared in winter](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/news-story/8076116-city-sees-sidewalk-snow-clearing-as-a-high-priority-/#.Wl52zrEws3s.twitter). Keep the pressure up!

Melissa Bowman, chair of the Victoria Park Neighbourhood Association also writes of [her neighbourhood's support for ensuring sidewalks are accessible in winter](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/8082105-let-s-talk-about-snowbility/), and former City of Waterloo councillor Karen Scian suggests that city [explore the use of private contractors](https://www.waterloochronicle.ca/opinion-story/8073025-city-can-clear-sidewalks-efficiently-by-getting-private-contractors-involved/) to keep sidewalks clear.

## Cabinet shuffle

Cambridge MPP Kathryn McGarry was appointed Minister of Transportation last week, [raising some hopes for future Cambridge GO train service](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8078768-new-transportation-minister-will-dig-down-on-go-train-to-cambridge/). Kitchener Centre MPP Daiene Vernile was also promoted to Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Sport. We hope she'll continue the efforts of her predecessor, Burlington MPP Eleanor McMahon, in fostering cycle tourism.

## School zone

Some of the dangers of driving kids to school were realized this week in Waterloo Region, and Ontario. On Monday, [a parking attendant was struck](https://www.newhamburgindependent.ca/news-story/8080774-parking-lot-attendant-hit-by-vehicle-at-adam-beck-school/#.WmTtcrBBeFc.twitter) by a driver attempting to exit the Adam Beck School parking lot the wrong way. On Tuesday, a [mother struck a bylaw officer with her car](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/mom-parent-dangerous-driving-no-stopping-zone-bylaw-school-1.4491243), who was issuing her a ticket for stopping in a no stopping zone near Wilson Ave Public School.

## Transit

New [public information centres](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/2018-public-information-centres.aspx) have been announced for the 2018 GRT network changes. Meanwhile, work will soon begin on a [new Fairway Road bus terminal](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8081732-new-bus-terminal-will-be-built-on-fairway-road/) to integrate with the ION stop, and the Region buys a [bus simulator](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/news-story/8080820-region-spends-1-27-million-on-bus-simulator/?utm_content=bufferec994&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) to help train its drivers.
