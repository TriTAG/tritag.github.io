**[Find our election survey for Waterloo Region, Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo candidates at tritag.ca/election2014](https://tritag.ca/election2014)**

The Tri-cities Transport Action Group would like to make the following statement regarding [Planning and Works Committee Report E-14-117 ION Construction - Progress Update](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/PA2014-0930.pdf#page=86):

TriTAG is pleased to see efforts well underway to build ION. With **$739 million** spent or committed by the time the next council takes office, and a further **$1 billion in private investment** along the Central Transit Corridor, the notion that this election is about whether or not to build light rail should finally be laid to rest.

TriTAG looks forward to hearing from all candidates about how they plan over the next four years to ensure the successful completion and operation of ION, and maximize the return on our transit investment.<!--more-->

**About TriTAG:**

The Tri-Cities Transport Action Group is a volunteer group founded in 2009 to advocate for better walking, biking, and transit in Waterloo Region, with a focus on practical infrastructure and solutions. Since then, TriTAG has engaged with the public, the media, and government on a wide range of transportation issues, so people can get around Waterloo Region on foot, by bike, and by transit easily and with dignity. 

TriTAG is conducting a survey for municipal elections candidates which will be published at [https://tritag.ca/election2014](https://tritag.ca/election2014) after October 1.
