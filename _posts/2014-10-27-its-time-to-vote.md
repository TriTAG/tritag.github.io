### Voter resources from TriTAG

If you're still on the fence,Â TriTAG's [Election Candidates' Survey](https://tritag.ca/election2014) will help you figure out what candidates will do to improve transit, walking, and bicycling. If you haven't looked at the survey since we first released it, we now have responses from more than 2/3 of all candidates!

TriTAG has also created an [election myth-busting series](https://tritag.ca/mythbusting) on issues surrounding light rail. Please share with family and friends who might have misconceptions about light rail transit.
