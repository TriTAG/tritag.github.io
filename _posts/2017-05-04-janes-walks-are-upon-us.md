For one weekend every year, cities across the world play hosts to [Jane's Walks](https://janeswalk.org), a collection of walking tours of our urban areas to explore, discover, and learn. Anyone can host a walk, and there are plenty of themes.

This weekend, Waterloo Region will be host to [dozens of different Jane's Walks](https://janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo-region/).Â  Given TriTAG's collective obsession with all things transportation, we thought we'd highlight a few for you! Click through for full walk details including length, meeting points, and other details.

##### [Transport in Time Walking Tour](https://janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo-region/transport/) (Uptown Waterloo, Saturday May 6, 2:30pm)

As you'll see, exploring the history of transportation in our cities is a common theme. This walk is led by the Waterloo Public Library's Local History Manager, and will explore the ways people arrived at and moved around the Village, Town and City of Waterloo.

##### [Jane's Ride from St. Jacob's Market to Uptown Waterloo](https://janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo-region/canada-will-celebrate-150-years-2017-join-me-janes-ride-st-jacobs-market-uptown-waterloo-we-will-be-riding-transcanada-trail-and/) (RESCHEDULED Saturday May 13, 9:00am - see [Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/329779047438297/) for more details)

Not an actual _walk,_ but on the other hand you'll get to explore the City of Waterloo's bike friendliness directly, with no other than Councillor Diane Freeman, long time advocate and supporter for better bike infrastructure. This trip on two wheels starts at the Market and goes to Uptown. If you're interested, definitely click through for additional important details.

##### [Back to the Future? The Iron Horse meets the Ion](https://janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo-region/back/) (Midtown KW, Sunday May 7, 2pm)

The history and ongoing development of this key piece of the central transit corridor, along with the direct and indirect impacts and influences of ION and intensification. What's not to like?

##### [Transportation in Berlin/Kitchener History](https://janeswalk.org/canada/waterloo-region/t/) (Downtown Kitchener, Sunday May 7, 1:30pm)

If downtown K-town is more your beat, then let Todd Bowman lead you around the core and talk about the history, evolution and influences on the city of different transportation modes over the years, from walking and biking to driving and transit!

So get out there and see our cities! Jane's Walks are a great way to connect with the places we live in and the people we live with. Just remember to [bring an umbrella](https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-82_metric_e.html).
