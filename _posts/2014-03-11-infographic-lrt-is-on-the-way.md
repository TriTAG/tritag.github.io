What is LRT? Why is it being built? How will it affect the community? When and where can I ride it?

ION Light Rail Transit (LRT) is the solution Waterloo Region needs to manage our growth, connect our region, and ensure a prosperous future. After a decade of study and public consultation, it's time to move forward, and time to get excited!

To celebrate ION coming up for its [final formal approval](https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/Staff-Recommendation.asp) and to consolidate some of the answers to frequently-asked questions, we've produced an infographic showing why ION Light Rail Transit is the best investment to move us around and shape our region's future.
