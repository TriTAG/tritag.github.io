A number of events and opportunities for public feedback are happening over the next week and a bit.

## Protected bike lanes for Uptown goes to Regional Council

After being approved last month by City of Waterloo Council, the recommended design for Uptown King Street is now up for approval by Regional Council. In addition to the portion from Erb to Central which the City approved, the Region will also be deciding the design of King from Central to University, and from Erb to the ION tracks and the Spur Line Trail. The recommendation contains more conventional bike lanes for this short stretch from Erb to the Spur Line, but it provides ample buffering to avoid conflicts between bikes and opening car doors.

While it is likely that the recommendation will be endorsed by Regional Council, (the Uptown BIA, Laurier, the City of Waterloo, and many in the community are in support), it appears there are [some delegates registered](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/PW/PA2015-0616.1.pdf) who might object to the design. If you have the time to show up at Council, or send a [quick email in support](https://contact.tritag.ca/uptown), we'd encourage you to do so.

**Date:** Tuesday June 16, 2015, 8:45am **Location:** Council Chambers, Regional Headquarters, 150 Frederick Street, Kitchener

The City of Waterloo is [developing plans](https://www.waterloo.ca/rapidtransit/) for zoning and infrastructure around ION stops to maximize the potential of rapid transit and develop transit-supportive neighbourhoods. They are hosting a public open house to provide input.

**Date:** Tuesday June 16, 2015, 5:30-7pm **Location:** Luther Village (139 Father David Bauer Dr, Waterloo). Great Hall room

## Columbia/Lexington EA deadline for comments June 17

The deadline for comments on the [proposed design for Columbia and Lexington](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/columbia-street-environmental-assessment.asp) is June 17.  The preferred alternative includes a multi-use path from Davenport across the highway to Holbeach (where signage will direct people biking  to the Forwell Trail), but would not connect directly with cycling infrastructure on Columbia on the far side of King Street for the foreseeable future.

## Travelwise Bike to Work Breakfast

The area is planned by the City of Kitchener as a future mixed-use corridor. New options being considered are multi-use paths, on-road protected bike lanes with raised curbs, and off-road protected bike lanes.
