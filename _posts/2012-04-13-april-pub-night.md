Next Tuesday the 17th, TriTAG will be hosting our monthly pub night from 6:30pm to 9:00pm to chat with anyone and everyone interested in transit and active transportation in Waterloo Region. Our plan is to hold these the third Tuesday of every month.

Stop by and bring your friends - we'll be in the Harp Room at [McCabe's](https://www.mccabesirishpub.ca/Kitchener/) at King & Francis in downtown Kitchener. (If you like, join the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/227151194058522/).)
