## TriTAG this week

On the blog, we questioned [why vehicles were being prioritized over pedestrian safety](https:///blog/2016/09/19/this-corner-shows-whats-wrong-with-transportation-planning-in-waterloo-region/) at the corner of Queen and Charles, where the sidewalk tapers to less than a metre. We also called for an [all-day frequent network](/blog/2016/09/21/how-long-should-you-have-to-wait-for-the-bus/) for iXpress routes.
