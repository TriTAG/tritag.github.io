## Local government

- CBC KW has been interviewing several local elected representatives to talk about the past year. [Waterloo Mayor Dave Jaworsky](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/waterloo-dave-jaworsky-2016-year-ender-1.3907117?cmp=rss) talked about LRT construction, trails, protected bike lanes, and making transit more grid-like, [Regional Chair Ken Seiling](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/2016-ken-seiling-yearend-interview-1.3910640) said ION light rail will give the Region a more European feel, and [Waterloo MPP Catherine Fife](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/catherine-fife-ndp-2016-year-end-interview-1.3907203?cmp=rss) lamented our sluggish and infrequent GO train service.
- Chris Klein shares his insights on [how to best affect change when serving on a municipal advisory committee](https://waterloons.blogspot.ca/2016/12/thoughts-on-advisory-committees.html?m=1).
- The Record serves up an [A-Z guide to local politics in 2016](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7037437-local-politics-in-waterloo-region-from-a-to-z/).

## Vision Zero

- The Record editorial board makes a surprising, but very much welcome pitch for [banning right turns on red lights](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/7034025-putting-brake-on-right-turns-on-red/) to reduce collisions with pedestrians.
- Lawyer Patrick Brown suggests in the absence of an Ontario vulnerable road users law, that [cities declare _all_ of their streets "Community Safety Zones"](https://www.bikelaw.com/2016/12/20/urgent-bylaw-declaring-toronto-streets-community-safety-zones/) to provide an added deterrence to speeding and other forms of reckless driving.

## Transit

- [Woolwich Council votes against spending more money to expand transit service](https://observerxtra.com/2016/12/22/woolwich-nixes-additional-expenditures-bus-route/) in the township. A few councillors' statements seem to betray a lack of understanding of transit - from how much it must be subsidized in low-density areas, to the fallacy of empty buses and the belief that smaller buses can cost considerably less than regular ones.
- As GRT prepares for a [delayed launch of the EasyGO fare card](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7026396-grt-edges-toward-new-electronic-fare-system/) in the spring, it is figuring out how to best provide cards to social agencies that currently give out paper tickets to residents who need them.
- The new [Cambridge Centre bus terminal](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7032378-region-unveils-new-grt-station-at-cambridge-centre/) is now open. The ION aBRT route will now be able to operate more directly.
- Metrolinx has developed a [GO Rail Station Access Plan](https://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/projectevaluation/studies/GO_Rail_Station_Access_Plan_EN.pdf). It provides several recommendations for improving walking, cycling, and transit access for the Kitchener and Breslau stations (see pages 81-87).
- [ION light rail construction is now 90% complete](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7035590-lrt-construction-90-per-cent-complete/), up from 29% at the beginning of the year, but the first ION vehicle which was due to arrive December 21 is [now expected in February](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7034797-region-won-t-get-light-rail-train-for-christmas/). With new development charges beginning next year, [planned tax increases for light rail will be reduced](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7023752-lrt-taxes-expected-to-be-trimmed/) in 2018 and 2019.
- TransitCenter introduces the concept of [_tactical transit_](https://transitcenter.org/2016/12/19/why-tactical-transit-is-the-next-big-thing/) - low cost, temporary improvements to test and deliver enhanced transit corridors in the short term, rather than through extended assessment and procurement processes.

## Bicycling

- San Fransisco publishes the results of their [testing of different styles of protected bike lanes](https://www.sfmta.com/about-sfmta/blog/we-tested-raised-bike-lane-san-francisco-here’s-what-we-learned). They recommend lanes that are level with the sidewalk, have a vertical curb, and provide buffer space between both cars and pedestrians.
- The Toronto Centre for Active Transportation launches a [new study on active transportation best practices for 'outer ring' communities outside the Greenbelt](https://www.tcat.ca/general-news/active-transportation-best-practice-beyond-the-greenbelt-new-study-begins/). We're guessing they'll be watching the future Uptown protected bike lanes with great interest.
- Tom Babin shares [insights from the Calgary downtown cycle track network pilot](https://shifter.info/the-unlikely-success-of-calgarys-bike-lane-network-has-these-lessons-for-other-cities/), which has now been made permanent.
- It's a small change, but the [MTO has expanded its section in the driving manual on how to drive around people cycling](https://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section2.3.2.shtml).

## Autonomous cars soon? Maybe not

- Uber's self-driving cars, operating without permission in California, have been [caught performing dangerous 'right hook' turns in bike lanes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/19/uber-self-driving-cars-bike-lanes-safety-san-francisco).
- In response, Linda Bailey, executive director of National Association of City Transportation Officials highlights the [dangers of partially automated cars](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/311336-the-dangers-of-partially-automated-driving-cars), while Joe Cortright of City Observatory suggests some tongue-in-cheek [pedestrian safety "innovations"](https://cityobservatory.org/timely_technologies_pedestrians/) to avoid inconveniencing passengers of autonomous vehicles.
