## Transit

It's here!

[![](/images/mjb-video-1024x582.jpg "the second ION light rail vehicle has arrived")](https://www.facebook.com/groups/81680629050/permalink/10155297539769051/)
*The second ION light rail vehicle has arrived*

The Region has opened its [online survey](https://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/274/Issue_5438) for the 2018 budget. Shockingly, after committing to fare increases under 2% per year over the next few years in the GRT business plan, the survey asks residents if they would accept a whopping **75 cent fare increase** per trip! This is far beyond any of the [punishing fare increases](/blog/2016/06/30/grt-a-brief-history-of-fares/) the Region has made in the past.  Please complete the survey and ask the Region to invest more in transit, not gouge riders any further.

Metrolinx is planning to [upgrade its track through Guelph](https://guelph.ca/wp-content/uploads/cow_consolidated-agenda_100217.pdf#page=22), which includes replacing the mainline and improving crossings, with the intent of improving speeds from 10 mph to 30 mph. This should help speed up GO train trips, eventually.

## Trails and walkability

The Region moves forward with its plans for a [twisty route between the Iron Horse Trail and the future transit hub](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7594220-region-moving-ahead-with-imperfect-trail-in-downtown-kitchener/), while leaving options open in the future to straighten it out or even follow parallel to the rail corridor. City councillor Frank Etherington is [not impressed](https://franketherington.ca/2017/10/04/region-says-get-lost-on-direct-iron-horse-trail-link/amp/).

On Wednesday, neighbourhood resident Sam Kamminga will remind Regional Council of the [need to maintain pedestrian access](/blog/2017/02/16/fairway-ion-crossing-update/) between the Fairway Road stores and the Traynor-Vanier neighbourhood, as ION completion closes the fence for good.
