## Transit

Meanwhile, [ION testing is ramping up](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8604144-high-speed-ion-testing-is-ramping-up/), Regional Council votes to keep advertisements off the outside of trains, and they're [hiring drivers](https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/applications-open-for-ion-lrt-drivers-1.3930184)!

## Sidewalks

Kitchener is readying plans to [test different sidewalk clearing options](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8599119-kitchener-mulls-sidewalk-snow-clearing-test/). Beyond a moral obligation to ensure all people are able to get around in winter, our cities now have [new provincial regulations](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/020239) for keeping sidewalks and bike lanes clear of snow and ice. Next week, Kitchener councillors will be asked to [approve sidewalk infill](https://kitchener.ca.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&event_id=476&meta_id=51829) in the Centreville neighbourhood.
