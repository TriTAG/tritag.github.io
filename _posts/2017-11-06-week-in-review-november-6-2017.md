*Injuries and deaths from distracted driving vs distracted walking in Ontario*

As we mentioned last week, a private member's bill that would ban "distracted walking" has been proposed. We delved into the numbers, and discovered that not only is [the impact of distracted walking extremely small](/blog/2017/11/02/the-myth-of-a-distracted-walking-crisis/) compared to other road safety concerns, but that the proposed legislation, through victim-blaming and distracting from real safety solutions, would do more harm than good.  Here's a few things others are saying:

## ION light rail

[Consultations for proposed stage 2 light rail routes through Cambridge](https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/News/index.aspx?newsId=6a8dfb2b-59a2-42e7-9fe8-143d26a18cbe) will take place November 21 and 28, in Galt and Preston. Meanwhile, the Region is [being vague about the start of testing vehicle 502](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4383719), saying only that it will begin "within the next two weeks," while also releasing video of more (overdue) vehicles being tested in Kingston:

## Transit

Friday is the last day to [send comments on the proposed 2018 GRT route changes](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/2018-transit-network.aspx). Getting the bus route redesign right to integrate with ION light rail and provide fast, efficient service will be critical to the overall transit network's future success.

As [Wellesley mulls municipal sidewalk clearing](https://www.newhamburgindependent.ca/news-story/7684449-clearing-sidewalk-snow-a-costly-idea-for-wellesley-township/), Kitchener looks for "[snow buddies](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/news-story/7767237-snow-buddies-needed-in-kitchener/)" to shovel sidewalks for residents who can't clear sidewalks on their own, as required under present bylaws.
