# Show your support for light rail and TriTAG

Just over two weeks ago, we told you about TriTAG's fundraising campaign to help us continue to advocate on your behalf for more transit, protected bikeways, and better walking conditions to make our communities great places to work and live. As a thank you for your support, we're making [special button pins patterned after ION light rail station designs](https://igg.me/at/tritag).

We've just reached the halfway point of our campaign. Here's what we've accomplished so far:

- $2,874 raised from 77 community members like you - that's 57% of our goal of $5,000!
- More than 1,000 ION buttons claimed including:
    - 25 limited-edition "UW goose" buttons
    - 7 framed button display sets
    - 3 ION route maps

Do you want to help TriTAG make Waterloo Region a better place to walk, bike, or take transit? Please consider [making a contribution](https://igg.me/at/tritag) of a few dollars if you can. $5 gets you a button for the ION light rail station of your choice, a $25 donation gets you all 19 stations.

To find out more, visit our Indiegogo campaign at [https://igg.me/at/tritag](https://igg.me/at/tritag) and help us spread the word!
