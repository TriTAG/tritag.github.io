## Election aftermath

The Progressive Conservatives have won a majority government in the Ontario Legislature. What does that mean for provincial transportation policy? Our best guess can be found in our review of party platforms and promises.

## Walking

Kitchener staff have shared their [plans to test winter sidewalk clearing options](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8665318-sidewalk-snow-clearing-test-would-cost-kitchener-760-000/): proactive enforcement, plowing after every snowfall, and a hybrid of property owners and city-run clearing where plows are only deployed after major snow events. The study would also try out sensors that can detect the presence of sidewalk snow and ice.

## Cycling

Waterloo Regional Police have released a pair of videos containing tips for people cycling and driving to "share the road" safely. The cycling video has [drawn criticism](https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/cycling-safety-video-created-by-police-draws-criticism-1.3969115) for admonishing "keeping to the right" at all times - in contradiction with [guidance from the City of Kitchener regarding sharrows](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/getting-around/downtown-sharrow-network.aspx#) and the [Ministry of Transportation's own cycling safety guide](https://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/pdfs/cycling-skills.pdf#page=18), which discourage staying to the right if the lane is too narrow to share.  According to [provincial guidelines for transportation engineers and planners](https://www.raqsb.mto.gov.on.ca/techpubs/eps.nsf/0/825810eb3ddd203385257d4a0063d934/$FILE/Ontario%20Traffic%20Manual%20-%20Book%2018.pdf#page=215), "sharrows are intended to guide cyclists as to where they should ride within a travel lane shared by both motorists and cyclists." We're don't tend to be fans of sharrows - too often they're a cop-out for real infrastructure - but it's disappointing to see our police contributing to the public's confusion surrounding them.
