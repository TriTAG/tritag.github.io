On December 5th TriTAG will be hosting the [Rally for Rails](https://lrtrally.ca) in partnership with Wonderful Waterloo and Waterloo Students Planning Advisory. It runs from 12pm to 1pm in Waterloo Public Square, at the corner of King St S and Willis Way. You can take a look at the [Rally for Rails event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=165886033433531).

For those of you that want to help us advertise the rally we have created "ticket" leaflets that you can distribute and posters than you can put up. All of these are PDFs which **should be printed with Page Scaling set to None** on the Print Options dialog. The posters will look best if trimmed to size, as they are shorter than standard letter paper.
