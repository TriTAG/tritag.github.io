The Iron Horse Trail is under threat from development, as we've [posted about before](/blog/2012/05/03/designing-to-improve-the-iron-horse-trail/). **We need you to [tell city council](https://tritag.ca/m/IHT)** that development should be designed around transportation, rather than vice versa. Mady Corporation is proposing to buy the Iron Horse Trail between Park and Caroline Streets in Waterloo in order to facilitate a second tower adjacent to the 144 Park development, rerouting the trail to what we believe is an inferior alignment. The idea does not respect the intention of the trail as an important transportation corridor, appearing instead to serve a goal of land consolidation. The issue and the details have been covered well by [Chris Klein](https://waterloons.blogspot.ca/2012/04/sanctity-of-trails.html) and [Mike Boos](https://real.uwaterloo.ca/~mboos/?p=639), so please follow those links for more information.

From the [comments to our previous post](/blog/2012/05/03/designing-to-improve-the-iron-horse-trail/), a couple of practical suggestions for the site included developing instead a triangular shaped building that fronts the trail with balconies or having the existing corridor go through the building complex. It is possible to develop the site in a way that works around and with the Iron Horse Trail, instead of moving it out of sight. If this developer isn't willing to do that, the location one block away from an LRT station will ensure that another developer will.

Do _you_ want the Iron Horse Trail moved to make way for condo development, so it travels in a shaded alley between two parking garages? Or would you rather see it preserved and improved instead, with development respecting the trail? It’s Waterloo City Council’s choice to allow the land swap, and **it’s up to you to [let them know what you think](https://tritag.ca/m/IHT)**.
