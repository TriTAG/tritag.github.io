\[caption id="attachment\_1235" align="alignright" width="400" caption="(Photo by Andre Recnik.)"\]![](/images/rally2.jpg "Rally for Rails II")\[/caption\] Rally for Rails II was fantastic! Thank you to the 250+ people who came out to Rally for Rails II and stayed despite the rain. And a special thanks to everyone who spoke, who helped us with organization, equipment, and setting up -- and to those who have [donated](https://www.tritag.ca/about/donate/) already. (It isn't too late to help out!)

Andre Recnik has some excellent [photos of the rally](https://blog.area256.com/?p=1043), and there is media coverage so far from [The Record](https://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/546587--rallies-for-and-against-transit-plan-make-voices-heard), [CTV](https://swo.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110611/LRTRallywriteup20110611/20110611/?hub=SWOHome), and [The Cord](https://www.thecord.ca/articles/46266).

Make sure your Regional Councillors [have heard](https://tritag.ca/m/lrt) why you support LRT, and consider sending a 200-word (maximum) letter to the editor to your favourite local papers.

This Wednesday, June 15, Regional Council is expected to finally vote on moving forward with rapid transit. The meeting will start at 7 pm at 150 Frederick St, Kitchener. Join us there to watch history in the making for Waterloo Region, and to show your support. (See also the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=205249586185888).) If you can't make it, the meeting should be broadcast on Rogers TV and those in attendance will hopefully be livetweeting using the #LRTvote hashtag.
