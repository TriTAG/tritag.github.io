Democracy isn't just for elections. Two weeks ago, we told you about [how you can help the Region set its priorities](/blog/2015/02/02/what-are-your-priorities-for-waterloo-region/ "What are your priorities for Waterloo Region?") for the next few years. But the Region isn't the only one listening - there are opportunities to engage with your governments at all levels. Below are just a few:

## Snowed out sidewalks

[![_ContentThumbnail1280X720](/images/ContentThumbnail1280X720.png)](/images/ContentThumbnail1280X720.png)Momentum is building for municipalities to clear sidewalks in winter. In yesterday's Record, Professor Alejandro López-Ortiz made a [strong case for snowplowed sidewalks](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/5337963-it-s-time-to-snowplow-sidewalks-in-the-region/).

You can lend your voice to the growing chorus by contacting your representatives through our [councillor contact form](https://contact.tritag.ca/sidewalks).  You can also add your support to having sidewalk clearing (currently under the jurisdiction of area municipalities) considered as a strategic priority for the Region through the [StratChat forum](https://stratchat.regionofwaterloo.ca/ideas/56810/municipally-cleared-sidewalks).

## Provincial planning

The provincial government is also seeking input as it prepares its budget for 2015. They've set up an [online forum](https://talk.ontario.ca/) where ideas for service delivery, investments, and efficiency can be proposed, rated, and discussed.

One idea we'd like to highlight is [funding for #CycleON infrastructure](https://talk.ontario.ca/idea/fund-cycleon-appropriately). #CycleON is the province's cycling strategy, but investment in bicycle infrastructure is needed to carry it out.

Other provincial surveys and public input opportunities:

- [Lowering default speed limits within municipalities](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/speedlimitontario?utm_content=buffercd6dd&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) (Ministry of Transportation)
- [Climate Change Discussion Paper](https://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTI0Mzcz&statusId=MTg3MjY0&language=en) (Ministry of the Environment)

## Waterloo's way

The City of Waterloo is also establishing its 2015-18 [Strategic Plan](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/strategicplan.asp). Visit [Open City Hall](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/open-city-hall.asp) to share your vision for the City.

In early spring, the possibility of protected bike lanes with [Uptown streetscape redesign](/blog/2014/06/05/uptown-streetscape-be-heard/ "Uptown streetscape: be heard!") is expected to come to council. Let your councillors know this project has your support with our [contact form](https://contact.tritag.ca/uptown).

## Even more opportunities...

To stay in-the-loop on opportunities to influence transportation-related decisions, you can [join our mailing list](https://eepurl.com/4Mtkf), [subscribe to our calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=tritag.ca_cqpciisuut93mukuejf7vc9nfc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Toronto) of public meetings, [like TriTAG on Facebook](https://facebook.com/TriTAG), or [follow TriTAG on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=TriTAG).
