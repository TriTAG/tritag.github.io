## **Cycling**

Cyclists don't follow the rules of the road? Maybe it's time to change those rules ([Tom Babin](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/livable-city/la-oe-babin-bicycle-laws-20161003-snap-story.html))

> "Yet streets are already governed by different rules for different users, such as laws that require slower speed limits for big trucks, or that mandate school buses to stop at uncontrolled railway crossings. Rather than demonize cyclists for their inability to conform to rules designed for cars, laws should recognize that riding a bike is different than driving."

## Transit

Pushing back on apathy about bus service ([Human Transit](https://humantransit.org/2016/10/pushing-back-on-apathy-about-bus-service.html))

> "If you want to know why your bus system isn’t better, the answer is almost always that not enough people care, and that in particular, not enough influential people care.  Sure, there are other kinds of resistance, but those can all be overcome when civic leaders decide that better bus service is important."

New option may see LRT in service as scheduled in late 2017 ([570 News](https://www.570news.com/2016/10/06/new-option-may-see-lrt-service-scheduled-early-2017/))

Why it will take more than light rail to fix US transit ([NextCity](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/public-transit-accessibility-turning-point))

> "The process begins by creating clear objectives tailored to each place’s needs. For all the flaws under the post-World War II approach, reducing congestion was a clear governing principle. Now cities and regions need to go back to the drawing board and formalize new objectives. Is it designing denser communities that support shorter distances between places? Is it to improve the amount of regional jobs people can reach in a given timeframe? Is it removing the physical barriers that separate communities? Whatever the objectives might be, each community must define accessibility on its own terms."
