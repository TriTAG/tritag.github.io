## Transit

- **Next year's transit improvements are being considered for next year's budget. Let Regional Council know you support funding more frequent transit in [this survey](https://www.peakdemocracy.ca/portals/153/Issue_1760).**
- Transit expert Jarrett Walker discusses how [opponents use the prospect of future "innovations" as an excuse not to invest in transit](https://humantransit.org/2016/11/how-innovation-chatter-limits-your-mobility-today-election-edition.html) with the technologies of today. (Waterloo Region saw its own fair share of this with aerobus, personal rapid transit, and even minibuses being proposed as alternatives to light rail, but the debate in other cities has now been ratcheted up with the new media fascination with yet-to-be-delivered driverless vehicles.)
- The Region is getting [over half a million dollars from the province to study how to improve its low-income transit fare discount program](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/6954350-region-gets-provincial-funding-to-study-low-income-transit-program/). The current waiting list for reduced-cost bus passes is about 1000.
- South of the border, the U.S. elections included several local referendums regarding transit projects, many of which succeeded. [The Transportation Politic](https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2016/11/03/on-the-ballot-2016/) and [NextCity](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/vote-transit-bills-2016-election) tracked many of these ballot measures. Laura Bliss on CityLab cautions that Republican control of the presidency and Congress mean that [federal funding for some of these projects may not materialize](https://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/11/on-tuesday-night-transit-was-victorious/507077/). Jarret Walker observes that the election results mean that [cities will need to do more to take care of themselves](https://humantransit.org/2016/11/cities-must-and-will-take-care-of-themselves-election-notes.html), and that the transit ballot measures show they are prepared to do so.

## Cycling

- The [Fountain Street bridge in Cambridge](https://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/cambridge-fountain-street-bridge-reconstruction-2-year-1.3845512) will be rebuilt with multi-use pathways on each side.
- Torontoist condenses the [top six things learned from the TCAT/Ryerson study on cycling in the GTHA](https://torontoist.com/2016/11/six-things-we-learned-from-ryersons-cycling-report/), while Cycle Toronto shows that [the Bloor Bike Lane pilot has actually increased traffic capacity](https://www.cycleto.ca/news/moving-right-along)
- People for Bikes present two videos that [capture perfectly how paint is insufficient to protect people who bike](https://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/the-reason-protected-bike-lanes-matter-in-9-seconds-video).

- Strong Towns [questions the value of sharrows](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/11/9/what-are-sharrows-worth), beyond encouraging people to bike (sometimes in places where it's less than ideal for them to do so!)
- Bloomberg highlights a [study that shows that making bike lanes may be one of the most cost-effective ways of improving public health](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-07/this-bike-lane-can-save-your-life). Meanwhile, another study shows that [the type and quality of bike lanes play a big role in preventing collisions and injuries](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303507).

## Vision Zero

- The Ontario government announced its intention to introduce new legislation to [allow the use of safety camera enforcement in school zones and community safety areas](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/photo-radar-kathleen-wynne-1.3841356). The [evidence shows that photo radar saves lives](https://slowottawa.ca/2016/03/23/guest-post-by-neil-arason-the-case-for-automated-speed-enforcement-in-ottawa/).
- The Globe and Mail has an article on how 'complete streets' are being built in the Greater Golden Horseshoe to [make roads safer and better for all users](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/meet-the-new-kind-of-street-coming-totoronto/article32828137/). Waterloo's Davenport Road is featured.

## Land use

- City Observatory explores how [zoning practices in North America effectively bans the creation of great walkable neighbourhoods](https://cityobservatory.org/great-neighborhoods-dont-have-to-be-illegal-theyre-not-elsewhere-2/).
- Strong Towns shares a [video from Mississauga showing it's not just enough to densify suburban sprawl](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/11/9/what-happens-when-you-densify-the-suburbs), if the underlying patterns and infrastructure are highly car-dependent.
- [ACCESS Magazine](https://www.accessmagazine.org) has published its Fall edition, with a focus on parking policies. Articles include arguments that [removing parking minimums is insufficient and more is needed to reduce parking oversupply](https://www.accessmagazine.org/articles/fall-2016/do-cities-have-too-much-parking/), a study of London's (UK) switch from parking minimums to maximums and [how important those maximums are for high-density areas](https://www.accessmagazine.org/articles/fall-2016/from-parking-minimums-to-parking-maximums-in-london/), and how [parking management is necessary for smart growth](https://www.accessmagazine.org/articles/fall-2016/parking-management-for-smart-growth/).

## Ride-sharing

The Region's new [vehicle for-hire bylaw takes effect December 2](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/6956734-vehicle-for-hire-bylaw-launch-won-t-be-perfect/). [Uber is hiring a local operations expert.](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/6961843-uber-hiring-operations-expert-for-waterloo/)
