As [covered](https://news.therecord.com/article/803364) in [local](https://swo.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101117/uptown-waterloo-king-street-101117/20101117/?hub=SWOHome) [media](https://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/824167), the City of Waterloo and the Region of Waterloo are currently working on [redesigning King Street](https://www.city.waterloo.on.ca/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=2565) between Erb and Central Streets in uptown Waterloo. This is a street that is arguably working poorly for all users -- on foot, on bicycle, and in motor vehicles.

Last week there was a public information centre to solicit feedback on the several alternative street cross-sections that are being considered. All the [information and panels](https://www.city.waterloo.on.ca/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=2600) presented there are now available. Please check them out and fill out [the city's survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/publicinformationcentre2) by January 5, 2011.
