## Transit

- The [2017 Regional budget was passed](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7063741-here-s-how-waterloo-region-will-spend-tax-cash-in-2017/) on Wednesday. New or more frequent trips for routes around Conestoga College and Cambridge, and for the 201 and 202 iXpress are being introduced this fall (bundles 1 and 2). Meanwhile, the already postponed 205 Ottawa Street iXpress (bundle 3) has been further delayed until spring 2018. For more details on the service changes, see the [budget issue papers](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/Budget/2017-Proposed-Budget-Issue-Paper-Package.pdf).
