## Walking and Cycling

- New drawings of the [first phase of the Uptown Streetscape](https://calendar.regionofwaterloo.ca/Council/Detail/2017-01-24-Planning-and-Works-Committee/PA2017-0124.pdf#page=28) and protected bike lanes have been published in preparation for a public information centre. They're a considerable improvement over [preliminary designs](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/contentresources/resources/living/Part_A_ESR_King_between_ION_tracks_and_Central.pdf#page=134), featuring tighter corners and shorter crosswalks, straighter bike paths, and cross-rides (like a crosswalk for people cycling) [at Bridgeport where a new trail is planned](/blog/2016/01/20/big-changes-for-bridgeport-erb-caroline-and-albert/). A significant addition appears to be previously ruled-out protected bike lanes between Erb and the ION tracks, which will provide more direct connections to trains and the Spur Line Trail. Attend the [public consultation January 31](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/uptownstreetscapeimprovement.asp) to find out more!
- [Frustrations mount](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7069522-uncleared-sidewalks-outside-kitchener-property-a-headache-for-pedestrians/) over the ineffectiveness of Kitchener's sidewalk clearing policy and how long it takes for complaints to be addressed.
- Kitchener company Miovision is launching [Miovision Labs](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7069269-miovision-launches-lab-to-spark-smart-city-innovation/) to mine and analyze the wealth of data its equipment collects for new innovations. One project, in collaboration with University of Toronto researchers, will [analyze conflicts and near misses with bikes along Bloor Street](https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/bike-lanes-bloor-street-u-t-engineering-partners-miovision-city-toronto-help-evaluate-pilot-track-traffic-safety/).
- [Trail resurfacing and upgrades](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7075671-waterloo-investigates-trail-upgrades-at-technology-park/) are being planned for UW's Research and Technology Park.

## Transit

- The Record looks at some of the [ION route options considered for Cambridge](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7075717-preliminary-cambridge-lrt-route-soon-to-be-released/) during 2015 consultations. [New consultations](https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/stage2ION/Public-Consultation-Documents.asp) on a recommended route are happening mid-February.
- The Region has [retained legal counsel for issues related to the King-Victoria Transit Hub](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/CouncilInfo.asp). This is among the first of many steps to bringing GO and VIA trains, light rail, city buses, and intercity transit to one central location.
- Late last year, the Region passed a new development charges bylaw that would help pay for ION light rail and bus service expansion. The Waterloo Region Homebuilders' Association has [launched an OMB appeal of the bylaw](https://calendar.regionofwaterloo.ca/Council/Detail/2017-01-24-Administration-and-Finance-Committee/FA2017-0124.pdf#page=42). At present, the bylaw remains in effect until the OMB rules otherwise.

## Car sharing, ride-hailing, autonomous vehicles, and of course, parking

- _Walkable City_ author Jeff Speck offers [ten ideas for maintaining walkable cities in the emergence of autonomous vehicles](https://www.routefifty.com/2017/01/mayors-autonomous-vehicle-transition/134729/).
- A study from UC Berkley's Transportation Sustainability Research Centre looks at [car sharing's impact on students](https://www.move-forward.com/college-carsharing-is-reducing-current-and-future-vehicle-ownership/), showing how access to shared vehicles defers vehicle ownership while improving quality of life in communities where not all destinations are easily accessible without a car.
- Transit expert Jarrett Walker writes about the [challenges of hailing and 'rating' his Lyft drivers during a snowstorm](https://humantransit.org/2017/01/three-lyft-rides-in-a-rare-snowstorm-and-musings-on-rate-your-driver.html) that exposed some weaknesses of ride-hailing apps.
- In honour of Martin Luther King day in the US, City Observatory looks at [two of the racial biases still inherent in our transportation system](https://cityobservatory.org/race-transportation-still-a-long-way-to-go/): "driving while black," and discrimination in taxi hailing.
- New research shows that parking demand for dense, mixed-use developments near good transit can be [less than half of what is predicted](https://nitc.trec.pdx.edu/news/guidelines-lead-parking-glut-transit-oriented-developments) in standard guidebooks.

## What we're reading

- Streetsblog shares [8 transportation engineering euphemisms that should be abolished](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/01/17/8-transportation-engineering-euphemisms-that-should-be-tossed-out/). Changing these words and phrases helps expose the biases towards traffic volumes inherent in the profession and allows many of the problems of transportation to be framed in more inclusive ways.
