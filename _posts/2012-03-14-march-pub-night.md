On Tuesday, March 20, TriTAG will be hosting our now monthly pub night to chat with anyone and everyone interested in transit and active transportation in Waterloo Region. We'll be there from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. ([Facebook event here](https://www.facebook.com/events/376010555756208/).) Stop by for some food, drink, and friendly conversation. (Food and drink at your own expense.)

We'll be in the Harp Room at [McCabe's](https://www.mccabesirishpub.ca/Kitchener/) at King & Francis in downtown Kitchener. There will be a digital projector set up for those who want to share something on a larger screen.

We hope to see many of you there!
