We now have 4 different posters you can help us put up around our community. All posters are sized for Ledger/Tabloid (11" x 17") paper, but can be printed on other sizes with trimmable margins.

We encourage you to print as many of these as you can, and put them up wherever you can, in colour or otherwise. Also, please consider [donating to TriTAG](https://www.tritag.ca/about/donate/) so we can print as many of these as possible in full size and full colour for distribution to local businesses and community centres.
