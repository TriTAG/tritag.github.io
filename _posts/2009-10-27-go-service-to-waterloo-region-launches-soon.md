Starting Saturday, October 31, GO Transit will launch its bus service in Waterloo Region. The service will create the region's first direct transit connection between Waterloo Region and Mississauga, two areas that exchange many commuters (in both directions). The service will be more than just for commuters, however, as buses will operate throughout the day and on weekends. Most will be Route 25 buses, operating between UW, WLU, downtown Kitchener, Cambridge SmartCentres, park and ride stations at Aberfoyle and Milton, and Mississauga Square One. Two Route 25A buses will connect to trains at Milton instead. See our [intercity transportation resources](https://tritag.ca/resources_intercity.php) page for more details, including information on connections from Square One.

This news has generated a lot of buzz in the region and at the universities, so we may well see GO adding more service quickly to this route. Hopefully this will serve to push along the plans for [GO train expansion](https://tritag.ca/initiatives_intercity_go.php) to Kitchener and Cambridge.
