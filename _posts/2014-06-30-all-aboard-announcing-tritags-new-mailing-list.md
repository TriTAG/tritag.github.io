TriTAG has maintained a mailing list over the past five years to let you know about important local transportation issues and events. In the past year, we've used our email list to keep you informed about [important LRT decisions](/blog/2014/02/26/where-will-ion-lrt-take-you/ "VIDEO: Where will ION Light Rail Transit take you?"), the [potential for protected bike lanes in Uptown](/blog/2014/06/05/uptown-streetscape-be-heard/ "Uptown streetscape: be heard!"), our [provincial election candidates' questionnaire](/blog/2014/06/05/all-candidates-questionnaire-ontario-election/ "All Candidates Questionnaire: Ontario Election"), and our 5th anniversary gathering.

**We hope this conversation can continue.**

New rules governing how emails can be sent and received in Canada come into force tomorrow. While we consider our existing mailing list to already use many of these practices (opt-in, unsubscribe at any time, etc.), because we want ensure you can choose to continue to hear from us, we've decided to start fresh with a new list that better satisfies these new requirements.

This means that if you've been on our mailing list in the past, you should have received an email over the weekend asking you to [re-subscribe](https://tritag.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b59eac59a2a2c1372558bf4c6&id=fa61181db0) - we won't be using the old list anymore. Of course, if you're new and weren't on our old list, you too can [subscribe](https://tritag.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b59eac59a2a2c1372558bf4c6&id=fa61181db0) and support our initiatives.

If you don't want to receive emails from us, you don't need to do anything. And as always, you can unsubscribe at any time from our list by following the links at the bottom of our emails. We'll be sad to see you go, but we'll understand.

Finally, if you have any questions or concerns about the way we communicate with you via email, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://www.tritag.ca/about/contact/ "Contact").
