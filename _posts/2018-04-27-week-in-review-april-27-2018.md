## Cycling

Last week, we were at the Ontario Bike Summit in Toronto. We learned a whole bunch, saw the [City of Waterloo take home a Gold Bicycle Friendly Community Award](https://www.570news.com/2018/04/21/waterloo-wins-gold-ranking-bicycle-friendly-communities-awards/), and heard Minister of Transportation Kathryn McGarry announce the [CycleON Action Plan 2.0](https://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/cycle-action-plan.pdf) and the [provincial cycling network](https://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/province-wide-cycling-network.shtml). We also picked up a copy of the [Complete Streets Game](https://www.tcat.ca/tool/complete-streets-game/) - you can [try it out at the CycleWR meet & greet](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cyclewr-meet-greet-tickets-45146257672) on Sunday!

We'll have more to say over the next little while about the summit and what Waterloo's new award means.
