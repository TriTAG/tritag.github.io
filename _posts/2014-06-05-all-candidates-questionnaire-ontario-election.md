<table><tbody><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea" width="25%">If elected, what steps would you take to bring fast two-way, all-day GO train service to Waterloo Region?</th><td width="25%"><b>Wayne Wright: Liberal</b> Yes, the business case was very well-made and persuasive. The Liberal government announced its commitment to double current service frequency between Kitchener and Toronto, from four to eight train trips per day in 2016. To support this, Metrolinx recently reached an agreement in principle to purchase the 53-kilometre rail corridor between Georgetown and Kitchener. This purchase would add significantly to the section of the Kitchener corridor that Metrolinx already owns and would provide additional flexibility and control to help improve service and reliability for GO commuters on the corridor. This is part of the government's commitment to deliver full-day, two-way GO train service. As you may be aware, Glen Murray, the Liberal Minister of Transportation was recently quoted as saying: "We're going to be moving very quickly within the next two to three years after that to take the diesels off, replace them with electric trains, these three- to six-unit trains, and we'll be running service to Kitchener, Waterloo and to the other communities along the line every 15 minutes all day," That's certainly something I could get behind. The Liberal government has asked Metrolinx to begin work immediately to examine opportunities to move GO service towards a regional express rail, providing fast and frequent electrified service on on all corridors at intervals as frequent as 15 minutes. This would represent a game-changer in how people move about the region, and enhance ridership and efficiency on GO Transit and other projects that connect to the network as well.</td><td width="25%"><b>James Villeneuve: NDP</b> The Ontario NDP will deliver two-way, all-day GO train service to Kitchener-Waterloo. We support the excellent local business case, which asked for provincial funding to start this year. It was very disappointing to see that the Liberals ignored that request; the Liberal budget included no specific funding for all-day, two-way GO to Kitchener-Waterloo. A NDP government will allocate funds from our $29 billion 10 year transit fund – and we will begin flowing funds immediately for two-way, all-day GO service to Kitchener-Waterloo.</td><td width="25%"><b>Michael Harris: PC Party</b> The Ontario PC Party is committed to bringing two-way, all day GO train service to Kitchener. The PC Party is the only party that will deliver GO service without raising taxes. It’s important to remember that Ontario already spends $12 billion a year on capital projects. We would re-prioritize funds in the capital budget for transportation and transit infrastructure. We would set aside $2 billion a year for infrastructure projects across Ontario including two-way, all-day GO train service to Kitchener.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to help fund phase 2 light rail to Cambridge to complete the Central Transit Corridor?</th><td><b>Wayne Wright: Liberal</b> The Liberal government supports key municipal transit projects, including the Region of Waterloo's 36-kilometre rapid transit corridor, with, as you mentioned, a provincial investment of up to $300 million, connecting the three major urban centres of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo. Construction of the adapted bus rapid transit (aBRT) component is expected to be completed by early 2015. Once that project is completed and in service, and the number of passengers increases to a sustainable level, we should be commencing an extension of ION through to Cambridge.</td><td><b>James Villeneuve: NDP</b> An Ontario NDP government will create a $29 billion 10 year fund to support transit and transportation infrastructure. We will ensure that the Region gets its fair share of funding to support transit, including working to complete the Central Transit Corridor. We will also restore funding for new buses with $60 million in annual support – funding that Kathleen Wynne cut.</td><td><b>Michael Harris: PC Party</b> In communities, like ours, local representatives decided that investing in a light-rail system for Kitchener-Waterloo and rapid bus transit for Cambridge made the most sense. We would honour this decision and the provincial funding commitment, which is already built into the budget.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what revenue tools would you make available to rapid transit and increased GO service in Waterloo Region?</th><td><b>Wayne Wright: Liberal</b> Ontario provides significant ongoing funding for municipal transit systems across the province by sharing two cents per litre of provincial gas tax revenues. Since 2004, the Province has committed more than $2.7 billion in gas tax funding. This program is now a guaranteed source of funding for eligible municipalities to improve and expand their transit services. Ontario Liberals were also excited by the Panel's recommendations, and the budget contained a proposal for a dedicated fund for public transit, including among other sources,the dedication of additional proceeds from 7.5 cents of the existing provincial gasoline tax to public transportation and transportation infrastructure, but, as a minority government, we were unable to find partners to support the recommended revenue tools. Political feasibility will be an important threshold in achieving additional revenues.</td><td><b>James Villeneuve: NDP</b> The NDP plan maintains the existing $29 billion dedicated fund for transit and transportation in the province’s existing fiscal framework. This includes allocating 7.5 cents per liter of the existing gas tax to public transit and transportation along with the other dedicated revenue measures described in the proposed Budget 2014. Importantly, our plan fully addresses the fiscal gap created by the repurposing of gas tax revenues and other measures, which Budget 2014 did not fully address. While maintaining the revenue integrity measures in Budget 2014, we will introduce a modest increase in the general corporate income tax rate. In addition, we will halt the phase-out of the HST Input Tax Credit Restrictions, which will save $860 million annually by 2018-19.</td><td><b>Michael Harris: PC Party</b> The Ontario PC Party does not support new taxes, fees and tolls. We would re-prioritize funds in the capital budget for transportation and transit infrastructure. We would set aside $2 billion a year for infrastructure projects across Ontario including two-way, all day GO train service to Kitchener. We will create an Ontario Transportation Trust to set aside dedicated revenue for transportation and transit infrastructure. We will raise funds for the Trust by selling surplus lands and buildings, like the LCBO headquarters in downtown Toronto.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to provide public transit connections between Waterloo Region and Guelph?</th><td><b>Wayne Wright: Liberal</b> In order to support economic growth and improve traffic flow, the Liberal government is committed to proceeding with a new four-lane alignment on Highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph. Property acquisition is currently underway and advance construction work will begin in the fall of 2015. Increased GO service will eventually provide frequent transit service between Kitchener and Guelph. In the interim, if GRT and Guelph Transit were able to come to an agreement to institute bus service between the two municipalities along the Highway 7 corridor, I could support that agreement.</td><td><b>James Villeneuve: NDP</b> I will work with Waterloo Region and Guelph to deliver better transit service. New Democrats have the best transit plan for our region. An NDP government will ensure that we get our fair share of transit investment. We are also the only party that will kickstart transit relief with a $250 million boost each year, and we are the only party that will restore funding for new replacement buses in 127 communities across Ontario, including Waterloo and Guelph. The Liberals have announced Highway 7 construction 3 times and haven’t followed through. We will follow through and build it now. The NDP transit plan makes sense for our region.</td><td><b>Michael Harris: PC Party</b> Our party believes that congestion issues between Waterloo Region and Guelph can best be addressed by expanding Highway 7. It is unfortunate that the Liberals cancelled Highway 7 in 2010 and then went on to waste $1.1 billion on the gas-plant scandal. Unlike the Liberals, the Ontario PC Party will get construction on Highway 7 started as soon as possible.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, would you work to see the bicycling and pedestrian safety improvements proposed in Bill 173 re-introduced?</th><td><b>Wayne Wright: Liberal</b> Bill 173 was a Liberal government Bill, introduced by the Hon. Glen Murray, Minister of Transportation. I would expect this Bill to be re-introduced if we are chosen to form the next government. As Liberal M.P.P., I would support passage of the Bill.</td><td><b>James Villeneuve: NDP</b> The Ontario NDP will also help communities make investments in bike lanes, expand cycling infrastructure networks, and support complete street design by guaranteeing $20 million over four years. Ontario NDP MPP, Cheri Dinovo introduced a one meter rule Private Member’s Bill and NDP MPP Jonas Schein has worked toward bike conterflow with a public petition. New Democrats are committed to making cycling a priority.</td><td><b>Michael Harris: PC Party</b> We will work with local decision makers to ensure we have safe roads for motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, how will you ensure municipalities have the right land use planning tools to serve their communities’ interests and transportation needs?</th><td><b>Wayne Wright: Liberal</b> The Region of Waterloo is appealing the OMB ruling against its Official Plan. In this appeal, the Region of Waterloo has the support of the Liberal government of Ontario, particularly since the Region's rewriting of its Plan was done to conform with the provincial government's Places to Grow Act, which has been described as the most ambitious attempt to curb urban sprawl in the province’s history.</td><td><b>James Villeneuve: NDP</b> We need to reform the unelected, outdated OMB. The OMB decision reveals systemic problems with the planning process and lack of consideration for local impacts. Instead of sensible transit options and a dependable plan for growth, Waterloo Region faces uncertainty and the high cost of urban sprawl. A NDP government would allow local councils to set up their own appeal bodies—the check and balance the OMB was supposed to be, but with the transparency and accountability that the Liberal government has actively prevented.</td><td><b>Michael Harris: PC Party</b> When it comes to smart-growth policies, we need to find the right balance to ensure that we are protecting the environment and providing better transportation systems while keeping home ownership affordable for families looking to purchase a house in Waterloo Region.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Kitchener-Waterloo

**The candidates:**

- Jamie Burton: Liberal
- Stacey Danckert: Green Party of Ontario
- Catherine Fife: NDP
- James Schulz: Libertarian
- Tracey Weiler: Ontario PC Party

<table><tbody><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea" width="25%">If elected, what steps would you take to bring fast two-way, all-day GO train service to Waterloo Region?</th><td width="25%"><b>Stacey Danckert: Green Party of Ontario</b> We agree, that this is absolutely essential to get people moving in Ontario. I think the most important first step is to have dedicated revenue tools that provide the necessary funding for this. We propose that we use a mix of tools such as congestion taxes, parking levies and a gas tax to allow for $3B in additional annual funding. Some portion of this funding should also be dedicated to providing ongoing costs such as maintenance and operation for municipalities. This accumulates to less than $1/day but will save the province $6B annually in losses (i.e., products to market, productivity, etc.).</td><td width="25%"><b>Jamie Burton: Liberal</b> The Ontario Liberal Party is committed to two-way, all-day GO service between Kitchener and Toronto. This commitment can be found on page 5 of our Infrastructure Plan in our platform.</td><td width="25%"><b>Catherine Fife: NDP</b> The Ontario NDP will deliver two-way, all-day GO train service to Kitchener-Waterloo. We support the excellent local business case, which asked for provincial funding to start this year. It was very disappointing to see that the Liberals ignored that request; the Liberal budget included no specific funding for all-day, two-way GO to Kitchener-Waterloo. A NDP government will allocate funds from our $29 billion 10 year transit fund – and we will begin flowing funds immediately for two-way, all-day GO service to Kitchener-Waterloo.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to help fund phase 2 light rail to Cambridge to complete the Central Transit Corridor?</th><td><b>Stacey Danckert: Green Party of Ontario</b> I am very supportive of improving transit both within and between our cities. One of the revenue tools that we should be offering to municipalities is more appropriate assessment of Developer Transit Benefit levees. These levees are paid by developers to reflect the extra value they receive from building in areas where local transit is upgraded. Unfortunately, those levees are tabulated based on transit from the previous decade and mean that it isn't until transit is fully functioning that new developments start to pay for the additional benefits they receive. Instead, the levee increases should begin when a new transit build is adopted, which allows for the offset of costs of the build itself - indeed the developers have planned the build based on the transit improvements. Indeed there is already an exception that allows for this for Toronto, and we believe it should be available to all municipalities.</td><td><b>Jamie Burton: Liberal</b> The Ontario Liberal Party is committed to helping fund LRT to Cambridge. This commitment can be found on page 6 of our Infrastructure Plan in our platform</td><td><b>Catherine Fife: NDP</b> An Ontario NDP government will create a $29 billion 10 year fund to support transit and transportation infrastructure. We will ensure that the Region gets its fair share of funding to support transit, including working to complete the Central Transit Corridor. We will also restore funding for new buses with $60 million in annual support – funding that Kathleen Wynne cut.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what revenue tools would you make available to rapid transit and increased GO service in Waterloo Region?</th><td><b>Stacey Danckert: Green Party of Ontario</b> Again, we believe in dedicated revenue tools and believe further that they should be tied to transit generally. Tools such as parking fees, congestion charges and gas tax increases offer two advantages: first, other priorities will not undermine transit improvements. Second, there is incentives to help shift behaviour to view transit as a preferred option.</td><td><b>Jamie Burton: Liberal</b> Our 2014 Budget outlined the revenue tools that would be used for Transportation Infrastructure. A total of $29 Billion will be made available for this investment. Below are details from the 2014 Budget, a Budget the Ontario Liberal Party has committed to reintroducing if re-elected Sources of Dedicated Funding About two-thirds of the dedicated funds for public transit and transportation infrastructure would be supported by: Dedicating proceeds from 7.5 cents of the existing provincial gasoline tax to public transit and transportation infrastructure priorities, starting in 2014–15. This would be over and above the existing gas tax funding provided to municipalities, with no increase to the tax rate from its current level Repurposing revenues from the existing HST charged on the current provincial taxes on gasoline and road diesel across the province towards public transit, transportation infrastructure and other key infrastructure priorities Dedicating proceeds from the following proposed targeted revenue measures to public transit, transportation infrastructure and other priority projects by: Restricting large corporations from claiming the small business deduction Restricting the fuel tax exemption for road-building machines Phasing in an increase of four cents per litre to the tax rate on aviation fuel over four years. Allocating net revenue gains from certain asset sales through the proposed Trillium Trust Dedicating net revenue gains from high-occupancy toll lanes when they become available. The remaining balance would be supported by: Leveraging provincial borrowing, when needed, including proceeds from green bonds Working with the federal government to secure federal funding through the Building Canada Plan for key transportation-related projects throughout the province.</td><td><b>Catherine Fife: NDP</b> The NDP plan maintains the existing $29 billion dedicated fund for transit and transportation in the province’s existing fiscal framework. This includes allocating 7.5 cents per liter of the existing gas tax to public transit and transportation along with the other dedicated revenue measures described in the proposed Budget 2014. Importantly, our plan fully addresses the fiscal gap created by the repurposing of gas tax revenues and other measures, which Budget 2014 did not fully address. While maintaining the revenue integrity measures in Budget 2014, we will introduce a modest increase in the general corporate income tax rate. In addition, we will halt the phase-out of the HST Input Tax Credit Restrictions, which will save $860 million annually by 2018-19.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to provide public transit connections between Waterloo Region and Guelph?</th><td><b>Stacey Danckert: Green Party of Ontario</b> I am opposed to building a new highway 7, through 144ha of farmland and wetland at a cost of over $400M - particularly since it will not solve congestion issues, but would likely just exacerbate them. Instead, moderate upgrades for safety should be completed on the current highway 7, and busing options between the two cities immediately improved. All day two-way GO service should be provided - and the line should be electrified to allow for faster service.</td><td><b>Jamie Burton: Liberal</b> With expansion of two-way, all-day go service to Kitchener, travel between Guelph and Kitchener will become much more easily facilitated between these two cities. A re-elected Liberal government would work with municipalities on future investment in municipal transit infrastructure</td><td><b>Catherine Fife: NDP</b> I will work with Waterloo Region and Guelph to deliver better transit service. New Democrats have the best transit plan for our region. An NDP government will ensure that we get our fair share of transit investment. We are also the only party that will kickstart transit relief with a $250 million boost each year, and we are the only party that will restore funding for new replacement buses in 127 communities across Ontario, including Waterloo and Guelph. The Liberals have announced Highway 7 construction 3 times and haven’t followed through. We will follow through and build it now. The NDP transit plan makes sense for our region.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, would you work to see the bicycling and pedestrian safety improvements proposed in Bill 173 re-introduced?</th><td><b>Stacey Danckert: Green Party of Ontario</b> We do believe this bill should be adopted, and Green Party members have been working towards improving cycling infrastructure for years. Since municipalities have limited revenue tools, we believe that the province should be providing funding to help re-prioritize our active transit options. We would dedicate 2% of the transportation fund to upgrading cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, which would currently amount to $60M.</td><td><b>Jamie Burton: Liberal</b> The Ontario Liberal Party has committed to reintroducing all government legislation that was still on the books when parliament dissolved. This commitment can be found on page 2 of the Making Government Work for Ontarians section of our platform</td><td><b>Catherine Fife: NDP</b> The Ontario NDP will also help communities make investments in bike lanes, expand cycling infrastructure networks, and support complete street design by guaranteeing $20 million over four years. Ontario NDP MPP, Cheri Dinovo introduced a one meter rule Private Member’s Bill and NDP MPP Jonas Schein has worked toward bike conterflow with a public petition. New Democrats are committed to making cycling a priority.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, how will you ensure municipalities have the right land use planning tools to serve their communities’ interests and transportation needs?</th><td><b>Stacey Danckert: Green Party of Ontario</b> We believe that the OMB needs an overhaul or at the very least an update to its mandate. The progressive, forward-thinking Official Plan created by this Region, which is in line with the intent of the Places to Grow Act, should be applauded, not overturned in favour of development. We should have tighter regulation and favour all planning that moves toward intensification. Further, we need to put legislation in place that provides permanent protection in place for our farmland and source water areas. Both of these will be at risk if the OMB ruling is upheld. Finally, anti-SLAPP legislation should be a priority so that community members can speak freely about their issues with local development options.</td><td><b>Jamie Burton: Liberal</b> Page 3 of the Clean, Sustainable and Livable Communities section of our platform lays out our plan to encourage smarter growth.</td><td><b>Catherine Fife: NDP</b> We need to reform the unelected, outdated OMB. The OMB decision reveals systemic problems with the planning process and lack of consideration for local impacts. Instead of sensible transit options and a dependable plan for growth, Waterloo Region faces uncertainty and the high cost of urban sprawl. A NDP government would allow local councils to set up their own appeal bodies—the check and balance the OMB was supposed to be, but with the transparency and accountability that the Liberal government has actively prevented.</td></tr></tbody></table>

As I'm sure you're aware, there are track upgrades that are necessary to make this happen. I would like to assure you that if elected, I will be a strong, vocal advocate at Queen's Park guiding this project to its completion.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to help fund phase 2 light rail to Cambridge to complete the Central Transit Corridor?</th><td><b>Margaret Johnston: NDP</b> An Ontario NDP government will create a $29 billion 10 year fund to support transit and transportation infrastructure.

This is part of our Moving Ontario Forward plan which underscore the importance of funding transit projects across the province.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what revenue tools would you make available to rapid transit and increased GO service in Waterloo Region?</th><td><b>Margaret Johnston: NDP</b> The NDP plan maintains the existing $29 billion dedicated fund for transit and transportation in the province’s existing fiscal framework.

The Ontario Liberals continue to review local transit needs, and I can assure you that the Region of Waterloo will continue to receive its portion of the provincial Gas Tax, which assists in paying for transit. Since 2003, the Region of Waterloo has received more than $63 million in gas tax funding. This is funding municipalities can count on to help sustain local public transit.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to provide public transit connections between Waterloo Region and Guelph?</th><td><b>Margaret Johnston: NDP</b> I will work with Waterloo Region and Guelph to deliver better transit service.

The two-way, all-day GO train between Kitchener and Toronto stops in Guelph, which means once this project is completed, it would provide regular transit service between Waterloo Region and Guelph.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, would you work to see the bicycling and pedestrian safety improvements proposed in Bill 173 re-introduced?</th><td><b>Margaret Johnston: NDP</b> The Ontario NDP will also help communities make investments in bike lanes, expand cycling infrastructure networks, and support complete street design by guaranteeing $20 million over four years.

The plan outlines sustainable development in order to balance the needs of the community with local economic interests. The Liberals are committed to developing sustainable, intensified, and integrated urban communities. As the OMB's decision is being appealed by the Region of Waterloo, and is therefore a matter before the courts, I am unable to comment on the specifics of the case. However, I would like you to know that I am supportive of the Liberal Government's intent to act as a party to the Divisional Court appeal. I know the Region of Waterloo developed its growth plan according to the Places to Grow Act. If elected, I would act as a strong voice for their community to ensure the Province is alongside the Region of Waterloo during the appeal.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea" width="33%">If elected, what steps would you take to bring fast two-way, all-day GO train service to Waterloo Region?</th><td width="33%"><b>Liz Sandals: Liberal</b> Recently, I was pleased to join Kathleen Wynne in announcing that full-day, two-way GO service will be coming to Guelph and the Waterloo Region. The number of trips from Toronto to Kitchener, stopping in Guelph, will double from two each in the morning and evening to four trips each way per day by 2016. To support this increase in service, an overnight train layover facility will also be constructed in Guelph and Metrolinx will purchase the 53-kilometre rail corridor between Georgetown and Kitchener. This purchase would provide Metrolinx with additional flexibility and control to help improve service and reliability for GO commuters on the corridor. Both of these projects are part of the Ontario Liberal Party’s commitment to deliver full-day, two-way GO train service. Looking past 2016, the Liberal government has asked Metrolinx to begin to quickly examine opportunities to move GO service towards a regional express rail, providing fast and frequent electrified service on all corridors at intervals as frequent as 15 minutes. This would represent a game-changer in how people move about the region, bringing more economic opportunities to the region, and enhance ridership and efficiency on GO Transit and other projects that connect to the network.</td><td width="33%"><b>James Gordon: NDP</b> The Ontario NDP will deliver two-way, all-day GO train service to Kitchener-Waterloo. We support the excellent local business case, which asked for provincial funding to start this year. It was very disappointing to see that the Liberals ignored that request; the Liberal budget included no specific funding for all-day, two-way GO to Kitchener-Waterloo. A NDP government will allocate funds from our $29 billion 10 year transit fund – and we will begin flowing funds immediately for two-way, all-day GO service to Kitchener-Waterloo.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to help fund phase 2 light rail to Cambridge to complete the Central Transit Corridor?</th><td><b>Liz Sandals: Liberal</b> No response</td><td><b>James Gordon: NDP</b> An Ontario NDP government will create a $29 billion 10 year fund to support transit and transportation infrastructure. We will ensure that the Region gets its fair share of funding to support transit, including working to complete the Central Transit Corridor. We will also restore funding for new buses with $60 million in annual support – funding that Kathleen Wynne cut.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what revenue tools would you make available to rapid transit and increased GO service in Waterloo Region?</th><td><b>Liz Sandals: Liberal</b> Ontario’s Liberal government has provided significant ongoing funding for municipal transit systems across the province by sharing two cents per litre of provincial gas tax revenues. Since 2004, the Liberal government has committed more than $2.7 billion in gas tax funding. This program now provides a guaranteed source of funding to eligible municipalities to improve and expand their transit services. To further solidify funding for transit infrastructure and start building on the Transit Investment Strategy Panel's recommendations, the Ontario Liberals included a proposal for a dedicated public transit fund for public transit in the 2014 budget. The proposal included three main provisions: • The dedication 7.5 cents of the existing provincial gas tax, an additional 5.5 cents over what was previously dedicated, to public transit and infrastructure; • The dedication of proceeds from targeted revenue measures to public transit, including restricting large corporations from claiming small business deductions, restricting fuel tax exemptions for road-building machines, and phasing in an increase of four cents per litre on aviation fuel over four years; and • The repurposing of revenues from existing HST charged on gasoline and road diesel towards public transit and infrastructure. Unfortunately the PC and NDP Parties failed to support the Liberal budget and forced an election, and as a result these proposed new revenue tools were not passed.</td><td><b>James Gordon: NDP</b> The NDP plan maintains the existing $29 billion dedicated fund for transit and transportation in the province’s existing fiscal framework. This includes allocating 7.5 cents per liter of the existing gas tax to public transit and transportation along with the other dedicated revenue measures described in the proposed Budget 2014. Importantly, our plan fully addresses the fiscal gap created by the repurposing of gas tax revenues and other measures, which Budget 2014 did not fully address. While maintaining the revenue integrity measures in Budget 2014, we will introduce a modest increase in the general corporate income tax rate. In addition, we will halt the phase-out of the HST Input Tax Credit Restrictions, which will save $860 million annually by 2018-19.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, what would you do to provide public transit connections between Waterloo Region and Guelph?</th><td><b>Liz Sandals: Liberal</b> As mentioned above, Increased GO service along the Toronto-Kitchener corridor will provide frequent train service between Kitchener and Guelph. This will help improve traffic flow between the two centres and reduce road congestion. The Ontario Liberal Party is also committed to proceeding with a new four-lane alignment on Highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph. Property acquisition is currently underway and advance construction work will begin in the fall of 2015. This project has been a priority for Guelph and Kitchener-Waterloo residents for a number of years and we are committed to seeing it through.</td><td><b>James Gordon: NDP</b> I will work with Waterloo Region and Guelph to deliver better transit service. New Democrats have the best transit plan for our region. An NDP government will ensure that we get our fair share of transit investment. We are also the only party that will kickstart transit relief with a $250 million boost each year, and we are the only party that will restore funding for new replacement buses in 127 communities across Ontario, including Waterloo and Guelph. The Liberals have announced Highway 7 construction 3 times and haven’t followed through. We will follow through and build it now. The NDP transit plan makes sense for our region.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, would you work to see the bicycling and pedestrian safety improvements proposed in Bill 173 re-introduced?</th><td><b>Liz Sandals: Liberal</b> Bill 173 was introduced by the Liberal government in March 2014 and unfortunately died on the table when the PCs and NDPs refused to support the budget. Should the Ontario Liberal Party be re-elected on June 12th, we will re-introduce the Bill and do our best to ensure that it is passed promptly.</td><td><b>James Gordon: NDP</b> The Ontario NDP will also help communities make investments in bike lanes, expand cycling infrastructure networks, and support complete street design by guaranteeing $20 million over four years. Ontario NDP MPP, Cheri Dinovo introduced a one meter rule Private Member’s Bill and NDP MPP Jonas Schein has worked toward bike conterflow with a public petition. New Democrats are committed to making cycling a priority.</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="99d9ea">If elected, how will you ensure municipalities have the right land use planning tools to serve their communities’ interests and transportation needs?</th><td><b>Liz Sandals: Liberal</b> No response</td><td><b>James Gordon: NDP</b> We need to reform the unelected, outdated OMB.
