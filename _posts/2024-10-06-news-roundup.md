* In Guelph, a driver killed cyclist Susan Ward in a hit-and-run. Later the same month, the same man crashed his car while driving impaired.

GRT will be using Route 7 and the Late Night Loop as the dedicated focus for the fully electric fleet – these are shorter routes, while the electric bus range makes longer routes a poor fit. GRT staff are [recommending](https://pub-regionofwaterloo.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=3f9fdf4d-8661-425e-b14a-b422ba3ad769&Agenda=Agenda&lang=English&Item=25&Tab=attachments) continuing to consider hybrid and conventional buses in its upcoming procurement plans.
