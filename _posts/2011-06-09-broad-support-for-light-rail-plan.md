We've updated and expanded our page of [supporters of Waterloo Region's LRT proposal](https://www.tritag.ca/light-rail/supporters/), with links to specific statements where we could find them.

Many businesses and organizations of all kinds have come out in support of the staff-recommended Rapid Transit plan. At the bottom of that page we've also added a section listing organizations that have come out against the plans - it turns out to be a very short list!

If we've missed any organizations or endorsements, please [let us know](https://www.tritag.ca/about/contact/).
