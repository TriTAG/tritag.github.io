## Transit

In his State of the City Address, Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig laments the [lack of GO trains to Cambridge](https://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/cambridge-go-train-service-mayor-doug-craig-1.4110109) via Milton, despite 15 years of advocacy. He sees possibility in using the [spur from Guelph to Hespeler and Preston](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7309947-mayor-unhappy-cambridge-s-go-train-hopes-seem-stalled/) to connect to the Kitchener Line.

Communitech celebrates the ION light rail project as '[urban planning done right](https://news.communitech.ca/columns/view-from-the-loo-waterloos-lrt-is-urban-planning-done-right/).' Meanwhile, [the Region won't be joining Metrolinx's backup plan](https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/region-won-t-follow-metrolinx-into-buying-non-bombardier-lrvs-1.3411696) to purchase light rail vehicles from French manufacturer Alstom, in case Bombardier trains won't be ready - the train storage and maintenance facilities would need to be rebuilt, and a new order would be years away from delivery. Metrolinx  is buying 61 trains from Alstom, which could lead to a surplus of vehicles if Bombardier eventually follows through on its order of 182 trains, [especially now that some of Toronto's originally planned light rail lines have been cancelled](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/05/11/metrolinx-to-buy-vehicles-from-bombardier-competitor.html).

## Cycling

Bill Bean laments the [state of our local bike lanes in springtime](https://www.takethelane.me/take_the_lane/2017/05/i-hate-bicycle-lanes-in-the-springtime.html), strewn with debris from the winter. That hasn't stopped [96-year-old Elta Lincoln from riding a bicycle for the first time](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7306051-her-first-bike-ride-at-age-96/), via a tandem wheelchair bike.

## Vision Zero

Ontario legislators continue to discuss the school zone safety camera bill in committee, but the government has [rejected an amendment for school bus cameras](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/05/06/ontario-debating-school-bus-cameras-to-catch-drivers-who-illegally-pass-stopped-buses.html), citing the need for further study. The amendment would have allowed for convictions for passing a stopped school bus based on video evidence alone, without requiring witnesses as is the case today.

A new study in the American Journal of Public Health finds that while pedestrian and cyclist deaths have declined over the past few decades in Canada and the US, [our progress lags behind that of other developed countries](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303546). The study authors credit the better infrastructure and slower streets of European cities for their improved outcomes.

## Land use

Upcoming changes to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) may make it [impossible to appeal the approval of developments within 500 metres of rapid transit](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/omb-challenges-to-be-barred-within-500-metres-of-transit-stations/article34979676/), including light rail and GO stations. This could help growth around light rail, where density is needed to make ridership a success. Other reforms would strengthen the decision-making power of municipal councils and prevent appeals of Official Plans.

TriTAG member Michael Druker looks at the [remarkable transformation of the Northdale neighbourhood](https://medium.com/@m_druker/how-a-waterloo-suburban-neighbourhood-is-becoming-urban-804042c32a3e), situated between the main UW and WLU campuses. It could soon become the Region's newest downtown area.

More work continues on the [Highway 7 replacement](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7295189-work-on-new-highway-7-will-begin-to-take-shape-in-2017-says-mto/) between Kitchener and Guelph. Columnist Luisa D'Amato hopes that by the time convicted drunk driver Ahmed Darwish gets out of jail, [autonomous cars can prevent impaired driving deaths](https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/7306072-d-amato-technology-could-stop-another-ahmed-darwish/).
