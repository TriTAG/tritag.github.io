On Tuesday the 19th, TriTAG will be hosting our almost monthly pub night to chat with anyone and everyone interested in transit and active transportation in Waterloo Region. We generally hold these the third Tuesday of every month.

Stop by and bring your friends - we'll be at [McCabe's](https://www.mccabesirishpub.ca/Kitchener/) at King & Francis in downtown Kitchener. You should see us straight ahead past the entrance, but if not, ask when you enter. (If you like, join the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/443041829048077/).)
