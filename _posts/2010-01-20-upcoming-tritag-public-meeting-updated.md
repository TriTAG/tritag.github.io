If you are interested in what we are doing in Waterloo Region and would like to share your suggestions in person, or better yet to figure out how you can contribute to TriTAG's activities, please come out to our public meeting next **Wednesday**. We will discuss transit and active transportation issues we expect to be dealing with, and chart a course for ongoing action.

The meeting will be at the [main Kitchener Public Library](https://kpl.org/locations/main.html) in Meeting Room B, on Wednesday, January 27, at 7:00pm. (Details are also [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=254935483806 "Facebook event for the meeting").) We hope you will join us.

(This time has changed from the initial posting.)
