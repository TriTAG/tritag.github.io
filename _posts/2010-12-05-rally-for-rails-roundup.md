Resounding success at Rally for Rails! At least 200 of you braved the freezing cold for an hour to support the Region of Waterloo's LRT project. The Rally was covered on [CTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bueAjEYaN7o), and in [The Record](https://news.therecord.com/article/825694).

Remember, the train doesn't stop here - your friends, neighbours, relatives and local businesses need to know the truth about LRT, and we need your help. If you have run out of double-sided information pamphlets, you can download more for printing at the (PDF) links below:

Finally, thank you all for coming out today. Each and every one of you who attended helped make this a resounding success!
