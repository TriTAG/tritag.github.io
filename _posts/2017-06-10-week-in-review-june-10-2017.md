## Vision Zero

In a victory for sidewalk infill policy, Regional Council declined this week to cancel plans for [completing a gap in the sidewalk on Westmount Road](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7359252-final-stretch-of-sidewalk-to-be-installed-on-westmount-road/), to which fronting homeowners were objecting. A [pedestrian crossover](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7363961-victoria-park-to-get-new-type-of-crosswalk/) - an unsiganlized crosswalk where people walking have the right of way - is planned for Victoria Park at a busy crossing. And Kitchener's new [neighbourhood-led traffic calming program](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/resources/Neighbourhoods/2017.05.17-Resident-led-Traffic-Calming-Easy-Steps-FV.pdf) is now on the city website.

## Climate (in)action

Climate Action Waterloo Region has published its [5 year progress report](https://www.climateactionwr.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Our-Progress-Our-Path.pdf). As we noted last week, transportation emissions have grown instead of shrunk, accounting for half of our carbon footprint. Climate Action is hosting an [event](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/our-progress-our-path-tickets-35181476744?aff=eand#tickets) to discuss the report and kick off a series of public engagements on June 22.

Elsewhere, [John Lorinc questions Toronto's climate plan's dependence on a hypothetical sudden surge in electric vehicles](https://spacing.ca/toronto/2017/06/08/torontos-strange-climate-change-plan-age-trump/) and expectations of only modest emission reductions due to transit use. And Joe Cortright takes governments to task that [claim support for the Paris Agreement but undercut their own efforts by building or widening roads and highways](https://cityobservatory.org/how-green-was-my-city-hall/).

## Cycling and trails

On the blog, we shared how Kitchener is considering ['advisory cycling lanes'](/blog/2017/06/08/krug-street-how-to-make-the-most-of-limited-space/) for narrow portions of Krug Street. Meanwhile, the Iron Horse Trail through Victoria Park is getting some [long-overdue lighting](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/news-story/7361676-iron-horse-trail-upgrades-to-include-lights/) to improve safety when the trail is widened this year.

## Transit

Kitchener Post columnist James Bow argues that [GO Transit should take over more of our intercity bus routes](https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/opinion-story/7354121-provincial-government-should-take-the-bus/) from private carriers, and do a better job of it.
