In follow-up to [my WonderfulWaterloo post yesterday](https://bit.ly/mwSnfJ) and [today's front-page Record article](https://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/540165--rail-critics-point-to-election-pledges) written by Jeff Outhit, I have a recording of that interview.

If you ever wondered how interviews get distilled into what gets printed, please ask me by e-mail at tim.mollison@tritag.ca , because we have not obtained consent to broadcast the interview, and that would include posting it here.
